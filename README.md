# Project - February 2023 - GU-Q Research

The GU-Q Research website compiles all the research that has been done by scholars during their tenure at Georgetown University in Qatar. The website is a resource for the Georgetown community, as well as the general public, to learn about the research that has been done at the university. The website is also a resource for the university to showcase the research that has been done at the university.
