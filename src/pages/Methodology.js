                The Georgetown University in Qatar (GU-Q) Research Database is a
                comprehensive platform that aims to showcase and explore the
                intellectual contributions of esteemed scholars affiliated with
                GU-Q. The data for this dynamic and all-encompassing database is

                By utilizing a diverse set of data sources and involving
                multiple data handlers, the GU-Q Research Database ensures that
                the platform offers a broad spectrum of scholarly works produced
                by the GU-Q community. It focuses on publications crafted during
                each author's tenure at GU-Q, starting from the year after their
                appointment, and proudly bearing GU-Q as the author's
                institutional affiliation. However, publications before the
                author's affiliation with GU-Q or those affiliated with
                institutions other than GU-Q or Georgetown University are not
                included in the database. This thorough methodology enables

                and breadth of GU-Q's scholarly impact, and embark on a journey
