    "abstract": "Emerging digital entertainment media in the Global South are anchored in nation-state configurations, benefit from supranational affordances, and aspire to global operations. Drawing on Sassen's “third spaces,” the article focuses on the case of Shahid, a Middle East-based video streaming platform and a hybrid media venture that operates at the intersection of the local and the global. The article suggests digital media entertainment territoriality is such that content services simultaneously inhabit geographic nation-state borders and transversally closed bordered spaces, and point to potential reconfigurations of power dynamics with such ventures functioning as spaces for negotiating cultural politics in the region. © The Author(s) 2021.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the production of local maps of Qing Khalkha Mongolia in the 19th century. In 1864, the Zongli Yamen initiated a mapping policy that aimed at designing a coherent system of geographical correspondences to record places, distances, and boundaries on the Mongol steppe. This system departed from the longitude and latitude system and enabled the correspondences of boundary markers on the maps and in situ. The producers of geographical knowledge were local Mongol banner and aimag rulers who had to coordinate with neighbors to set the location of obu?as or boundary-markers, draw maps, and record the set boundary-markers on an addendum accompanying the maps. The mapping standards issued by the central state elicited expressions of resistance among local Mongols who actively negotiated the mapping aesthetics and advocated for their own ways of representing the land. The result was a localized form of geographical knowledge that rendered visible the gap between a prescriptive state view on steppe geography and local practices of territorial administration.",

    "abstract": "Globally, mainstream media excludes or misrepresents many societal groups, resulting in significant community absences. In these contexts, alternative media plays a vital role in offering meaningful self-representation and political participation. This type of media becomes crucial in revolutionary contexts, where people rise against the injustices of their governments in hopes of change. This article offers a case study approach to revolutionary music in the Middle East, where we review the socio-economic and political contexts behind the emergence of alternative media in Lebanon and Egypt. We analyze our cases by using Bailey et al.’s (2007) comprehensive approaches to alternative media. We propose that revolutionary music evolves and adapts to larger changes in the public sphere. Still, as the article concludes, while music can enable a persistent community when demanding change, it does not guarantee an actual change in the political system. © 2022 Polish Communication Association.

    "abstract": "This study examines the extent to which women are represented among the world's highly cited researchers (HCRs) and explores their representation over time and across fields, regions, and countries. The study identifies 11,842 HCRs in all fields and uses Gender-API, Genderize.Io, Namsor, and the web to identify their gender. Women's share of HCRs grew from 13.1% in 2014 to 14.0% in 2021; however, the increase is slower than that of women's representation among the general population of authors. The data show that women's share of HCRs would need to increase by 100% in health and social sciences, 200% in agriculture, biology, earth, and environmental sciences, 300% in mathematics and physics, and 500% in chemistry, computer science, and engineering to close the gap with men. Women's representation among all HCRs in North America, Europe, and Oceania ranges from 15% to 18%, compared to a world average of 13.7%. Among countries with the highest number of HCRs, the gender gap is least evident in Switzerland, Brazil, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States and most noticeable in Asian countries. The study reviews factors that can be seen to influence the gender gap among HCRs and makes recommendations for improvement. copyright 2022 Lokman I. Meho.

    "abstract": "Since winning the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, the Qatari government has channelled billions of dollars into infrastructural development to prepare for the tournament, which has ramped up the country's already high reliance on migrant labour. The international spotlight on migrant labour abuse has also become more intense as the date of the event approaches. Yet, human rights discourses surrounding World Cup 2022 continue to paint a simplistic and incomplete picture of migrant labour in the Gulf, where racism and its correctives are defined through the white gaze, with undercurrents of Orientalism and Islamophobia. In contrast, we offer a historical and transnational framework for understanding contemporary racialised labour and immigration systems in the Gulf. Effectively improving everyday life for migrant workers in the Gulf requires engaging both local stakeholders and the multiple actors and institutions—both inside and outside Qatar—involved in reproducing these systems. © 2022 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Recent developments in genomic technology, especially those enabling gene editing, promise to put an end to hitherto intractable medical problems and to usher us into the age of personalized medicine. These technologies, however, raise a number of serious ethical challenges. Given the global impact of this technology, recent international regulations emphasize the need for intercultural dialogue on these ethical issues. This paper concentrates on Islamic perspectives on human genetic modification. It examines Islamic juristic discourses on the issue of genetic modification and highlights the different layers within these discourses. The paper identifies the main positions regarding human genetic modification along with the underlying arguments for each of them. In general, these positions are articulated in light of the nature as well as the intended objectives of the different procedures. The paper devotes special attention to the treatment-enhancement distinction and argues that within Islamic discourses this distinction is quite nuanced. The paper points out important substantive and methodological gaps and emphasizes the evolving nature of Islamic discourses on this issue. copyright 2022 Journal of Religious Ethics, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The divine purpose theory (DPT) — according to which human life is meaningful to the extent that it fulfills some purpose or plan to which God has directed us — encounters well-known Euthyphro problems. Some theists attempt to avoid these problems by appealing to God’s essential goodness, à la the modified divine command theory (DCT) of Adams and Alston. However, recent criticisms of the modified DCT show its conception of God’s goodness to be incoherent, and these criticisms can be shown to present an analogous set of problems for the DPT. Further, the argument can be extended to any account of meaningfulness according to which the value of what humans do can only be conferred by God. Thus, it would seem that there is no tenable version of the view that meaningfulness is conferred on human life by some act or attitude of God's. The Euthyphro dilemma presents a significant problem for DPT and should ultimately compel its advocates to concede that human life is meaningful independent of God's wishes, commands or purposes. Indeed, the Euthyphro dilemma represents a threat to a wide range of projects in theist value theory — from theistic metaethics to theories of the meaning of life — and theists working in these areas need to defend critical foundations of their theory from the threat posed by recent formulations of the dilemma. © 2022.

    "abstract": "Introduction: This introduction presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in the subsequent chapters of this book. The book presents we-intentions as Sellars's solution to the problem of intersubjectivity in moral reasoning, since I-intentions (due to their indexicality and their merely relative reasonableness, that is, their reasonableness relative to collateral intentions of the subject) cannot serve in what Dach calls “consonant practical reasoning”. It explores dimension of the problem of intersubjectivity in moral reasoning by discussing whether we should interpret Sellars as advocating a collectivist or an individualist account of we-intentions. The book compares Sellars's theory of practical reasoning to G.E.M. Anscombe's. It addresses Sellars's project of causal reductionism, specifically with regard to the moral “ought”. The book offers an account of intentionality and the Good that fits within the naturalistic framework developed by Sellars.",

    "abstract": "Conventional wisdom about the European sovereign debt crisis and its handling defends that fiscal austerity is unpopular and that external conditionality and/or imposition on national democracies generates backlash. However, not enough research has addressed this question: How willing are citizens to accept unpopular policies imposed on their national governments by European institutions? Would they object to unpopular policies less if these were coming from their national representatives? In this article, we propose a survey experiment, complemented by four focus groups, to test whether citizens' willingness to accept economic policies varies depending on whether the decision originates in the national parliament or in EU institutions. The experiment was conducted in Spain in 2017. Our results show that agreement with a particular policy does not depend on the policy-making actor but on the policy's content. The bitter pill of austerity is no less bitter because elected politicians decide it at home. Similarly, EU 'diktat' does not make a popular policy less popular. Our conclusion is that Spanish citizens during the Euro crisis objected to the policy of austerity due in large part to its content and not to the EU intervention in favour of implementing it. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to explain why, despite numerous collective and individual efforts, states have failed to eradicate terrorism produced by Islamic extremism. What alternatives to present paradigms possibly exist in the battle against terrorism and extremism? Through its neo-Kharijite and takfiri character, the irreconcilable extremism that developed at the end of the Cold War due to a leadership vacuum in the Islamic world, has caused widespread unease among Muslims and others. As a result, the current study approaches the topic of countering extremism from an entirely new perspective, which is nearly unprecedented in the literature. Because the current ways of combating extremism are either war or spreading alternate narratives. However, this piece resurrects a historic practice of weakening extremism. The revival of the Balkh school as an existent and viable alternative narrative in the Islamic world might diminish extremist and takfiri discourses. The Balkh school is a good opportunity to revive a peaceful tradition among Muslims in order to end extremism. A good and better way is to update and expand successful and effective narratives of the past that have shown significant achievements in the field of moderation and reciprocity with the use of modern tools. copyright 2022.

    "abstract": "Muslim marriages are far from homogeneous, and the inherent variability of norms and practices is often missing in the framing of such marriages in Western societies. Marriage and family laws in Muslim-majority contexts are sights of contention, debate, and development. These debates often center around family as a site of state governance driven by overlapping national and international agendas; gender equality and calls for marriage law reform; and tensions between Islamic jurisprudence, state laws, and lived realities. This introductory article sets the scene for this special issue focusing on the plurality of norms and practices in Muslim marriages within Muslim-majority jurisdictions.",

We diagnose the problem with picturing as follows: on the one hand, it seems that it must be connected with action in order for it to do its job. On the other hand, the representational states of a picturing system are characterized in descriptive and seemingly static terms. How can static terms be connected with action? To solve this problem, we adopt a concept from recent work in Sellarsian metaethics: the idea of a material practical inference, which (we argue) features centrally in how we picture. The key distinction is that the picturing of nonhuman animals involves only Humean material practical inference, in which representa-tional states are corrected only by feedback from the environment and not from discursive interactions. The resulting view shows that Sellars's contributions to practical philosophy (especially theory of action and metaethics) cannot be sepa-rated from his contributions to philosophy of mind, language, and cognitive science. Further, the view makes it clear that picturing is neither a version of the Given, nor is it a fifth wheel to inferential role in explaining representation, but is essential to Sellars's model of how animals-including humans-represent their environment.",

In particular, we are interested in studying the following political and institutional factors: political stability, rule of law, regulatory quality, control of corruption, and voice and accountability on new businesses registered. Empirical results indicate that political stability is found to have the strongest positive and significant impact among all other political and institutional variables, followed by rule of law, and control of corruption, while regulatory quality and voice and accountability are found to have an insignificant effect on new businesses registered. The outcome of this study helps policymakers in Qatar in figuring out the main political and institutional policies that need improvement to further develop and promote the private sector. copyright 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

Nonetheless, the juxtaposition of political disparities amongst Middle Eastern countries is quite peculiar. Sports fans worldwide are used to seeing some Middle Eastern brands sponsoring European sports and are becoming more familiar with watching sporting events such as Formula 1 races, golf and tennis tournaments broadcasted from the region. Although primarily located in Asia, Middle Eastern countries belong to three different geographic regions and continental sporting federations: Africa, Asia and Europe. Across most Middle Eastern countries, there are also strict nationality laws to adhere to (with few notable exceptions, such as Turkey), requiring a father of national descent to become a citizen. It is also impossible to avoid the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on sport worldwide, including in Middle Eastern countries.

    "abstract": "Far and away the most popular sport in the world, football has a special place in Middle Eastern societies, and for Middle Eastern states. With Qatar hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, this region has been cast into the global footballing spotlight, raising issues of geopolitical competition, consumer culture and social justice. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, this book examines the complex questions raised by the phenomenon of football as a significant cultural force in the Middle East, as well as its linkages to broader political and socioeconomic processes. The establishment of football as a national sport offers significant insight into the region’s historical experiences with colonialism and struggles for independence, as well as the sport’s vital role in local and regional politics today–whether at the forefront of popular mobilisations, or as an instrument of authoritarian control. Football has also served as an arena of contestation in the formation of national identity, the struggle for gender equality, and the development of the media landscape. The thirteen contributions to this volume draw on extensive engagement with the existing body of literature, and introduce original research questions that promise to open new directions for the study of football in the Middle East.",

The huge weight of economics and petroleum politics make it imperative part of parcel of any study to review the dynamic due as well as the influencing factors on how authorities derive to certain decisions and what are the basis of their overall considerations. This paper is examination of the complex individual influences central to the way in which decision-making is pursued, most notably from the point of view of the cognitive, normative, and psychological perspectives. The aim is by utilizing qualitative and quantitative data analysis to outline the likelihood influence of cognitive biases in decision processes as well as examine the relationships of these biases on outcomes of decision made about development of Caspian Sea oil & gas joint deposits. Subsequently, depict how to avoid the adverse impacts and risks (economic, political and social risks) in future. The ultimate aims are to derive to a series of lessons learned, which becomes an input to improve the decision making process in future development of Caspian Sea joint field of oil and gas deposits and its resolutions. It also addresses many hidden issues behind many decisions made by Iranian decision makers regarding the development of joint fields of Caspian Sea oil and gas resources and as to how and why the political-economic related reasons for government actions usually camouflaged and rarely discussed publicly by politicians or media.",

    "abstract": "With an increasing number of Pakistani workers seeking work in the monarchies of the Persian Gulf, there is a need to expand our understanding of how these workers navigate the frequently challenging migration process. Limited access to accurate information about migration opportunities and complex and over-bureaucratic visa application processes means that for many Pakistanis the only way to reach the Gulf is through the assistance of the transnational, profit-oriented, labour recruitment industry. Given limited state regulatory capacity over recruitment agencies, many Pakistani migrants arrive to their jobs in the Gulf under duplicitous contractual conditions and carrying excessive amounts of debt. This chapter, based on fieldwork carried out in Pakistan, draws on migrants’ own experiences with labour recruiters, as well as their experiences of living and working in the Gulf, to evaluate the processes and practices of migration governance across this corridor. This research shows not only the value of focusing on a subnational component (Pathan migrants) to better interrogate governance processes, but also demonstrates how ‘slips’ into irregularity stem from state-level negligence and insufficient regulatory control over recruitment processes in sending and receiving countries. This research suggests that migration experiences and outcomes are shaped by existing structures of labour migration governance in the Gulf and the profit-generating recruitment industry that provides much-desired access to the Gulf labour markets.",

The paper shows that for some consumer goods in the United States and other countries, one can approximate expenditure shares using weights derived from the retail distribution of sellers. These weights are based on the share of outlets selling an item, or the share of outlets adjusted by the total number of items sold in each. Relative to using no weights, the paper finds that using such imputed weights substantially reduces bias in the frequency of price changes, in annual inflation, and in price comparisons across countries.

    "abstract": "Transitional justice practices in the Arab World have unfolded in ways that both reinforce the value of the critical turn in transitional justice while also underscoring its limitations. Used as both a tool of repression and of resistance, transitional justice practices in the Arab World mark a significant development in the field by expanding its dynamic processes across time and space. Ongoing violence and the resurgence of authoritarian rule have necessitated a transitional justice process that aims to help deliver on the revolutionary objectives of the Arab uprisings themselves: to uproot decades of structural oppression and authoritarian rule. This article begins with a brief review of the critical turn in transitional justice and how it presents questions, limitations, and opportunities with regard to key transitional justice practices in the Arab World. Next, it will examine how such practices have made the state and its institutions as object of transitional justice as opposed to its enforcer. The article will then address the potentials of universal jurisdiction as a transitional justice strategy that has just as much to do with a broader political project, such as weakening an authoritarian regime, as it does with the narrower goal of putting regime officials on trial. Finally, I argue that transitional justice in the Arab World is a tool of resistance to colonial and neo-colonial powers, making it an important engine of Third World Approaches to International Law praxis.",

    "abstract": "It is generally agreed that statutory limitations applicable to civil proceedings have no place in international arbitration proceedings, unless these have been specifically accepted by the parties; are imposed by mandatory laws, or; otherwise compelled by public policy. In equal measure, the process and recognition of enforcement awards should not be subjected to any statutory limitations, as such limitations are absent in the New York Convention and generally excluded by reference to transnational legal instruments, such as the uncitral Model Law. Investor and commercial actors operating in Central Asia should be cautious when embroiled in disputes with state entities because of the latter tend to protract and delay negotiations in order to impose statutory limitations to claims. It is imperative that upon commencement of negotiations foreign entities take appropriate measures to ensure that their claim is not undergoing a ticking time-ban. This may be achieved by serving the other party with an official notice as to the commencement of negotiations and a statement that this is not a substitute of a civil suit or arbitral proceedings. Equally, one of the parties may trigger arbitral proceedings but ask the arbitrators to suspend all hearings until after the termination of negotiations.",

    "abstract": "This chapter reviews the evolution of labor reforms in Qatar before the World Cup bid, as well as those that have been reinforced since 2015 and are currently underway. The chapter is built around three arguments. The first is that labor reforms that have occurred in Qatar have not been solely due to the global human rights campaign around the World Cup. Qatar's decision to undertake reforms have been a result of a far more complex set of factors. The chapter's second argument contends that despite the state's undertaking of labor reform efforts, their current trajectory, and their long-term potential to guarantee greater protection of labor rights, it is disingenuous to assume that lower income migrants' lives will be radically transformed. The third contention is that Qatar 2022 represents a missed opportunity for global human rights organizations and journalists who spearheaded the campaign. By focusing solely on the conditions of migrant workers as a separate category of concern, and by adopting a myopic lens that does not connect broader local and regional demands for labor rights, the campaign dilutes its potential to galvanize demands for enduring change, and reproduces the Gulf to the global public as an Orientalized, exceptional space.",

    "abstract": "In the tumultuous aftermath of the Arab uprisings, Tunisia charted a unique path that has earned it praise as ‘a beacon of hope’ in a troubled region. Since the 2011 revolution, it has embraced a new culture of democracy, based on pluralism, civilian rule and the peaceful transfer of power. Equally noteworthy are the country’s burgeoning civil society, its various institutional reforms and its progressive new constitution, which upholds individual freedoms and champions women’s rights. But in spite of these achievements, daunting challenges remain. Although Tunisia has succeeded in defusing many crises, its transition has been uneasy; its democracy is fragile and its future continues to be uncertain. As the country emerges from decades of authoritarian rule, it faces enormous political, social, economic and security challenges, which are undermining its peaceful evolution. It is this state of fragility that A Fledgling Democracy seeks to capture. Focusing on the socio-political dynamics that have unfolded in this North African nation since the revolution, the contributors to this volume shed light on how Tunisia has navigated its first decade of democratic transition, and explain what the ongoing changes and challenges mean for the country today.",

    "abstract": "In this roundtable discussion, five scholars of modern India with diverse methodological training examine aspects of Rupa Viswanath's 2014 book, The Pariah Problem: Caste, Religion, and the Social in Modern India, and assess its arguments and contributions. This book has made strong challenges to the scholarly consensus on the nature of caste in India, arguing that, in the Madras presidency under the British, caste functioned as a form of labour control of the lowest orders and, in this roundtable, she calls colonial Madras a 'slave society'. The scholars included here examine that contention and the major subsidiary arguments on which it is based. Uday Chandra identifies The Pariah Problem with a new social history of caste and Dalitness. Brian K. Pennington links the 'religionization' of caste that Viswanath identifies to the contemporary Hindu right's concerns for religious sentiment and authenticity. Lucinda Ramberg takes up Viswanath's account of the constitution of a public that excluded the Dalit to inquire further about the gendered nature of that public and the private realm it simultaneously generated. Zoe Sherinian calls attention to Viswanath's characterization of missionary opposition to social equality for Dalits and examines missionary and Dalit discourses that stand apart from those that Viswanath studied. Joel Lee extends some of Viswanath's claims about the Madras presidency by showing strong parallels to social practices in colonial North India. Finally, Viswanath's own response addresses the assessments of her colleagues. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to explore the two main viewpoints on Australia’s relationship with Asia; first, the highly visible informed pro-Asia protagonists, and second, pervasive public opinion as informed by history and the Australian self-image. The purpose is to present the polemic internal to Asian Studies and Business Schools currently. This paper postulates that only an (uncomfortable) whole-of-sector introspection would result in an authentic national narrative to drive mutual respect and business between Asia and Australia. Design/methodology/approach: The current dismembering of Asian Studies degrees and Asian Business specialisations at Australian universities indicates a waning national support to the production of Asian specialists able to link the Australian economy into the advancing Asian commercial dominance. But such an assessment would not be completely accurate. The authors argue that as an important component of Asian business and economics, understanding the current situation is vital to breathing life back into the Asian Studies and Asian Business Studies disciplines at Australian national universities. Findings: This paper concludes that the responsibility for creating specialists should fall to the university sector but is currently defaulting to the business sector. This paper proposes that business schools need to be more active participants in Asian engagement strategies. Thus, Australian universities and disciplines such as Asian Studies and Asian Business must have the academic will and the business support to take up a major role in positive evolution of the Eurocentric elements that currently hold back meaningful engagement. Originality/value: This is a current issue that needs to be addressed. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

It examines both efforts to digitize traditional records and the issue of the preservation of born digital records. The study finds that there is a considerable lag between the rate at which the Kenyan government is digitizing its operations and that at which it is developing and implementing protocols and systems for preserving digitally born records. This will impact both historical research and national heritage in future. copyright 2022 Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",

Once such effect has been the influx of foreign labor to address labor shortages in various sectors of the economy. The purpose of this paper is to  examine the  recent  situation  of  foreign  workers  in  Japan  who  have  been  impacted  by  these  immigration  policies, particularly considering the coronavirus pandemic. We present the results of in-depth interviews with such individuals to provide insight into their working and living conditions. We conclude that to date, the new immigration system has failed to live up to expectations, and if Japan wants to accept more foreign workers to boost its economy and realize faster progress in globalization, more efforts need tobe made at both the national and local levels.",

    "abstract": "The article contributed by Amira Sonbol is devoted to shari'a court records and Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) as sources for women's history. Using the issue of sexuality in Islamic sources as a starting point, she shows how studies on this matter stimulate even further studies which, in turn, are leading to a greater understanding of the impact of states and modernity on women's lives, as well as revealing new tools to challenge state control over gender issues and women. Secondly, she illustrates how to use a wide range of sources for historical research beyond the mainstream. Shari'a court records and fatwas are often examined to discuss legal issues. In this respect, however, Sonbol attempts to expand their use and demonstrate how they may be valuable in uncovering various aspects of women's lives and gender relations. Throughout her article, we are also able to follow the author's own evolution across time as a scholar and activist working for women's rights.",

    "abstract": "The China model holds considerable appeal to states and publics in the Middle East, both as a political symbol and as a practical alternative for governmental and economic reform. An attractive alternative to what is often called the “Washington Consensus,” the China model depends on the effective institutional capacities and public acceptance that are distinct – even unique – features of China and other developmental states in East Asia, where state formation preceded the inclusion of popular classes and state leaders enjoyed wide latitude in choosing policies and practices. Viewed from this angle, the China model appears inapplicable to the states of the Middle East that were formed later, and whose leaders have consistently found themselves needing to cater to the demands of the popular classes. In most Middle Eastern countries, developmental economics – which is at the core of the China model – is sacrificed at the altar of politics.",

    "abstract": "Beginning in 2016 Iran’s naval posture in the Persian Gulf changed from a defensive-offensive strategy, which had been in effect since 2001, to an offensive one. This was reinforced in 2019–2020, when, in response to the Trump administration, Iranian military strategists determined that any potential confrontation with the country’s adversaries is likely to take place at sea rather than on land or in the air. After the end of the Iran–Iraq war, Iran’s naval strategies can be divided into three, each coinciding with different periods: defensive (1988–2001), defensive-offensive (2001–2016) and offensive (since 2016). The intensification of the US military presence in the Persian Gulf and issuing threats against Iran have played a central role Tehran’s adoption of an offensive naval strategy. Features of this new strategy include the development of ballistic and cruise missile programmes; development and deployment of drones in naval manoeuvres; the use of air defence in supporting naval operations; deepening Iran’s military presence in Persian Gulf islands; ensuring the ability to disrupt the flow of energy; conducting naval manoeuvres in collaboration with trans-regional powers and continued use of proxy warfare. Tehran believes the new strategy will help it better prepare for international threats. © 2022 British Society for Middle Eastern Studies.",

    "abstract": "Beginning with the premise that 'soft power' explanations fall short in explaining fully the ways by which states utilize football toward their political objectives, this chapter pursues a more expansive exploration of the political uses of football within authoritarian contexts among states in the Middle East and North Africa regions. Specifically, it argues that states have found uses of football as a tool for acquiring legitimacy in the face of internal and external threats. It demonstrates this by highlighting five categories of state instrumentalization of football. Utilizing cases studies that span the region over a two-decade period, it showcases state uses of football to legitimize neo-imperial control, to stabilize authoritarian transitions of power, to ward off external threats, to achieve goals of securitization, and to deflect criticism of unpopular policies in a practice known as sportswashing. Though they have appeared under different circumstances and have taken on a variety of forms, all of these state uses of football share the desire for legitimacy. The cases under examination demonstrate the limits of football as a form of legitimation, given its inability to address underlying concerns on the part of domestic and international audiences.",

    "abstract": "This chapter explores Palestinian football by focusing on the case of Lebanon, one of the largest host communities for Palestinian refugees. In comparison to other Palestinian diaspora communities, Palestinians in Lebanon have a limited presence in football. While football has served as a tool for integration in countries such as Chile and Jordan, Lebanese football has reflected the exclusion of Palestinians in society. This study argues that Palestinian footballers' lack of access to Lebanese citizenship--which is different from the experience of Palestinian immigrants and refugees in Chile and Jordan--is the main reason for the absence of Palestinian football success stories in Lebanon. This chapter examines how Palestinian football players in Lebanon are operating in a triple periphery. First, they are excluded from Lebanese football through lack of access to Lebanese nationality, which creates football-specific obstacles, such as a cap for Palestinian players in Lebanese leagues. Second, their status as stateless persons prevents Palestinians in Lebanon from representing their country of descent in international competitions. Finally, being stateless refugees restricts their potential movement to other football leagues abroad.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the digital turn in entertainment media industries, with particular attention to music streaming in the Middle East. It delineates the contours and workings of an emergent 'ecosystem' that underpins the music industry in the region. While recognizing that regional platforms develop and adopt technological innovations that echo global trends, the article highlights the unique ways they respond to local market needs, navigate sociocultural factors, and capitalize on audience fragmentation. Using the case of Anghami, the article argues that this burgeoning startup culture-which is characterized by mobile, social, and direct-to-consumer services-is disrupting established radio and recording industry practices, redefining stakeholders, and creating more connected digital communities. The broader aim of the article is to unravel the nature of digital adaptations and transformations in the Middle East and better understand the complexities and disjunctures that characterize the emergence, adoption, and experience of digitality in the region.",

    "abstract": "The culture of politics within any system of governance is influenced by how state and society interact, and how these relationships are mediated by existing political institutions, whether formal or informal. The chapters in this volume highlight two broad types of informal political engagement in the Middle East: civil action that works in tandem with the state apparatus, and civil action that poses a challenge to the state. In both cases, these activities can and do achieve tangible results for particular groups of people, as well as for the state. For many, informal politics and civil mobilization are not a choice, but a necessity to secure--collectively--some kind of social security, through communal reciprocity and everyday activism. Ironically, Middle Eastern authorities often turn a blind eye to informal organizing, because 'self-help' schemes allow certain social groups to survive--reducing their instinct to make demands of, or seek support from, the state. People are discouraged from political action and dissent; yet they are simultaneously encouraged to seek their own betterment, often leading to politicized groups and associations. By analyzing these formations, the contributors shed light on informal politics in the region.",

No matter what the personal or circumstantial drivers and reasons that propel it, migration on an annual basis occurs for millions of people. The term “migration” is itself used to describe varied and complex patterns of human mobility that occur internally within a state or region, as well as those taking place across borders, internationally, and trans-continentally. Migration can be applied to the categories of people moving as a result of their own agency, voluntarily, and as an individual or familial choice. It can also be used to describe the categories of those having to move by force or under duress, and this includes the mobility experiences of forced migrants, internally displaced persons, refugees, and asylum-seekers. © Zahra Babar and the Contributors, 2020.",

    "abstract": "This chapter analyses Spain’s mainstream conservative party, the Popular Party (PP). Of the two revolutions analysed in the book – the silent and silent counter-revolutions – the Popular Party only confronted the former for several decades. In general, it adapted to a more liberal society by moderating to capture centrist voters in the 1990s without losing far right voters, thereby remaining hegemonic on the right. Midway through the subsequent decade, Spain’s two main parties, the Socialist PSOE and PP, moved further apart on post-materialist and centre–periphery issues. Today, PP is severely weakened and ideologically sandwiched between two right-wing party challengers, the more centrist Citizens and the far right Vox. This political fragmentation is due to a favourable opportunity structure for the rise of new parties after 2010 – related to the Great Recession, political corruption and the push for independence in Catalonia. In this context, PP was unable to retain its diverse electorate. It now confronts dilemmas similar to those of many of its European counterparts, and the party’s initial response to the rise of Vox was to move rightward and accommodate it as an ally.",

Existing approaches to skilled migration have developed around the drivers and consequences of global talent mobility to and between traditional destinations in Europe and North America. However, in the emerging economies of South and Southeast Asia and the Arabian Peninsula, we find unique state regulatory frameworks, local labour market dynamics, and economic development trajectories that require new analytical approaches. Therefore, we review and re-examine existing approaches in light of the emergence of new players in the global competition for talent. We identify three strategies and examine cases from each: (1) global hubs for talent (Dubai and Singapore), (2) engaging with the diaspora (India and Malaysia), and (3) building local human capital (Saudi Arabia).

In this study, we provide the first in-depth examination of the impact the blockade had on Qatar’s economy and review the policy responses that followed. In particular, we consider how the policies that have since emerged either complemented or deviated from past policies and practices and evaluate whether they have in fact brought long-term benefits to the country -- benefits that may have not been realized had the blockade not taken place. Our review finds that the blockade did not cause a shift in policy direction, but it did change the urgency and process by which policies were put together and pushed forward, as well as their effectiveness. Furthermore, we find that the timing of the blockade worked in Qatar's favor in surprising ways. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide both a meticulous documentation of the policy responses that followed the blockade and an in-depth analysis of its impact. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "Data literacy skills are becoming critical in today’s world as the quantity of data grows exponentially and becomes the ‘currency’ of power. In spring 2020, a team of two librarians piloted a new one-credit course in data literacy and data visualisation. This report explains the rationale behind the project and discusses the place of data literacy within information literacy (IL) instruction. The authors describe the pilot’s learning objectives, topics covered, course design, the structure of assignments and the delivery of the course. They analyse the feedback received on the course and suggest ways to refine their practice. The article calls for a re-envisaging of the library’s role in data literacy instruction. It aims to address how librarians can extend their current practice of teaching IL to data literacy and why it is important. The authors’ experience may inspire other academic librarians to incorporate data literacy and data visualisation into their teaching practice. © 2021, CILIP Information Literacy Group.

    "abstract": "The Indian sage Ramana Maharshi (1879-1950) is perhaps the most widely known Indian spiritual figure of the last century, second only to Gandhi. This new book offers a fresh introduction to the Maharshi's life and teachings, intending to situate him within the non-dualistic traditions of Hinduism. It also delves into themes and questions particularly relevant to the spiritual crisis and search for meaning that have characterized, in various ways, both the modern and postmodern outlooks. While the Maharshi's background and frames of reference were traditional, the spiritual resonance of his teachings in today's world must also be recognized. The sage's message lies at the intersection of the contemporary search for Self-knowledge, and today's critical reflections on the foundations and limits of religion. Thus, the book comprises seven chapters that touch upon such central issues as the role of religion in Self-inquiry; the relationship between devotion and knowledge; the role and limitations of traditional forms; and the implications in our postmodern era of both the Maharshi's emphasis on surrender, and his basic question: 'Who am I?'",

    "abstract": "This article is a case study of one of the few sports, rugby, that does not link national representation exclusively to citizenship. It discusses who may represent a country in major events and under which conditions. It analyses the consequences of the rules on different stakeholders; and discusses why the residency rule in particular is subject to much controversy. The author has conducted case studies of the 2019 rugby union and 2017 rugby league men's World Cups. Academic literature, international news-papers, and rugby-specific websites were reviewed. Other than secondary sources, the researcher also collected primary data through interviews. The interviewees included representatives of Rugby League International Federation and World Rugby. This research reveals that national representation without citizenship is widespread in both codes of rugby. It has also shown that the effects of the eligibility criteria go beyond simplistic rich/poor and center/periphery models. This article argues that the rational for the eligibility criteria is the limited global spread of rugby league and rugby union. Without those lenient rules it would be difficult to organize international competitions. © 2021 Danyel Reiche, published by Sciendo.",

    "abstract": "Despite numerous studies of Iran in recent decades, the country’s concerted efforts to expand its medical diplomacy have been largely overlooked by experts and observers alike. This is despite the fact that the Islamic Republic has sought to employ medical diplomacy as a viable tool for expanding its soft power for a number of years. Over the course of the last two decades, in fact, Iranian authorities and health professionals have considered their medical advances to greatly add value to the country’s overall diplomatic profile. This article examines three basic questions: first, how has Iran used medical diplomacy to increase its regional influence in the Middle East? second, what are the factors that have contributed to the country’s success in this area? And, third, what are likely to be the regional consequences of Iran’s enhanced medical diplomacy in the future? The answers to these questions will present an overall picture of the current and future depth and voracity of Iran’s soft power.",

    "abstract": "Recent scholarship on trans-oceanic exchanges between the Persian Gulf and South Asia has delved into previously neglected minutiae of everyday migrant life beyond labour. Combining ethnographic research and media content analyses, I build on this scholarship through a novel study of vernacular radio as a critical means of sustaining South Indian (Malayali) diasporic communities betwixt and between their home and host societies. This paper shows, firstly, the interwovenness of work and leisure in the everyday lives of Malayali migrants in Qatar; and secondly, the role played by radio listenership and production practices in crafting distinctive ethnolinguistic spatialities of sound (sabdam) via sonic connections that transcend the binary between being at home and abroad. Paying attention to sonic waves and networks that bind together radio stations and audiences in Qatar across work and home spaces, I argue that diasporic vernacular radio both reinforces and challenges notions of ‘Malayali-ness’ within the Gulf Malayali community (bandham) and beyond. © 2021 The Author(s).

Second, the pandemic altered the customary view of the country's diplomacy. For more than four decades, Iran has regarded this diplomacy from the perspective of humanitarianism and ethics. But the pandemic imparted new object lessons. Third, the pandemic ushered Iran into a new era of cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO). Considering Iran's medical and other scientific achievements over the past three decades, it seems likely that pursuing this diplomacy can improve Iran's position in the WHO and enhance its prestige and influence within this and other international organizations, possibly easing the pressure of sanctions in the future. © 2021 The Middle East Policy Council",

    "abstract": "The culture of politics within any system of governance is influenced by how states and societies interact with each other, and how these relationships are mediated by existing political institutions—whether formal or informal. This study highlights two different types of informal political engagement in the Middle East: civil action that works in tandem with the state apparatus, and civil action that poses a challenge to the state—in either case, these are informal political engagements that can and have achieved tangible results for particular groups of people, as well as for the state. For many, it is not a choice to engage in informal political activity and civil mobilization, but a necessity in order to secure, collectively, some kind of social security through communal reciprocity and everyday activism. Ironically, because these “self-help” schemes are allowing certain social groups to get by, and are reducing their instinct to make demands and to seek subsistence from the state, authorities often turn a blind eye to informal activities. Not only are people discouraged from political action and dissent, they are simultaneously—and seemingly paradoxically—encouraged to seek their own betterment, often leading to the many politicized groups and associations discussed in this chapter.",

    "abstract": "The Middle East is currently facing one of its most critical migration challenges, as the region has become the simultaneous producer of and host to the world’s largest population of displaced people. As a result of ongoing conflicts, particularly in Syria, Libya, Iraq, and Yemen, there have been sharp increases in the numbers of the internally displaced, forced migrants, refugees, and asylum-seekers. Despite the burgeoning degree of policy interest and heated public discourse on the impact of these refugees on European states, most of these dislocated populations are living within the borders of the Middle East.This volume is the outcome of a grants-based project to support in-depth, empirically based examinations of mobility and displacement within the Middle East and to gain a fuller understanding of the forms, causes, dimensions, patterns, and effects of migration, both voluntary and forced. As the following chapters in this volume will demonstrate, through this series of case studies we are seeking to broaden our understanding of the population movements that are seen in the Middle East and hope to emphasize that regional migration is a complex, widespread, and persistent phenomenon in the region, best studied from a multidisciplinary perspective. This volume explores the conditions, causes, and consequences of ongoing population displacements in the Middle East. In doing so, it also serves as a lens to better understand some of the profound social, economic, and political dynamics at work across the region. © Zahra Babar and the Contributors, 2020.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides an empirical account of how Pakistani labour recruiters, or 'overseas employment promotors' (OEPs), manage the needs and expectations of their migrant-clients while contending with the challenges of state governance. OEPs' first-hand accounts suggest that they are frustrated by their inability to adequately ensure that the migrants they send to the Persian Gulf will thrive from the experience. OEPs identify three main issues that affect their ability to do their job well: unscrupulous recruiters and companies based in the Gulf who use the issuance of labour contracts to extract profits from migrants and Pakistani recruiters; a lack of support both from the Pakistani and Saudi Arabian state to address core issues that hamper migrants’ success; and the challenge of mediating long-distance on behalf of their migrant-clients once they are working in the Gulf.",

    "abstract": "The experience of the Omani-Zanzibaris who were forced to migrate from Zanzibar to Oman in 1964 has received relatively little attention, particularly as seen from the arriving/returning Omani-Zanzibaris’ emic perspectives. As we will see in this chapter, Oman’s identity as a cosmopolitan empire offers a variety of pathways for understanding its present-day culture and politics, as well as its responses to the large wave of arrivals from postcolonial Zanzibar. The chapter seeks to arrive at a better understanding of the forced migrations by telling the story of this period from the theoretical stance of hybridity, which challenges the prevailing essentialism of the historical narratives of the 1964 events as an African uprising against Omani colonizers. To expound the experiences of Omani-Zanzibaris, this project gathered multiple accounts drawn from multi-sited ethnographic research carried out in the first round of fieldwork in Oman and Zanzibar together with extensive conversations held in Zanzibar and Muscat in 2016 and 2017. Life-history collections, memoirs (both published and in private family possession in Arabic, English, and Swahili), archival materials in London and Muscat, and digital sources were also researched. © Zahra Babar and the Contributors, 2020.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates the development of militarism in the Arab Gulf using the militarized representation of the Bedouin and their poetic tradition as a site for its analysis. The article traces the ways in which Bedouin 'martial masculinities' and Bedouin culture have been appropriated and transformed by British colonialism and postcolonial nationalisms to produce unusual patterns of militarism within the Gulf. It addresses a gap in international relations and security studies literature, in which militarism is examined through state-centric and methodologically nationalist framings that largely overlook transnational and colonial histories. The article argues that contemporary displays of militarism by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates should be read in relation to how colonialism engendered militarism across the Gulf region through the paradoxical representation of the Bedouin as a 'martial race' whose martial-ness was also seen as a security 'threat' for the colonial/postcolonial state. Militarized responses and rationalities were normalized within Gulf society through the 'Bedouin warrior' stereotype, which served as a timeless and fixed construct, connecting the Gulf's disjointed past to its present-day context. Significantly, the 'Bedouin warrior' stereotype helps foster the belief that stability and historical continuity underpin state-modernization processes in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The article's intervention seeks to disrupt this continuity by looking at how militarism and its martial constructs created ruptures in state trajectories, using the example of the 1996 coup attempt, citizen revocations, and the depoliticization of the poetic act as evidence for the claim that militarism engenders particular insecurities for Bedouin populations in the Arab Gulf. © The Author(s) 2021.",

    "abstract": "The essay 'Stranger in the Village,' which appears in James Baldwin's Notes of a Native Son, provides both the essential epistemological and existential categories for understanding the profound implications of ontological blackness in a world dominated by white privilege. With lucid prose, he recounts his experience as the first Black visitor to a small, sleepy Swiss village and offers remarkable insight into the meaning of blackness that connects America and Africa. The village, with a population of about six hundred people was the quintessence of rustic, rural living: it had no movie house, no bank, no library, no theater, very few radios, one jeep, and one station wagon. In this predominantly Catholic 'white wilderness,' Baldwin grapples with the paradoxical connection between Christianity and conquest. Throughout the powerful essay, the question of Black identity looms large; it lingers, it stands unresolved, and it remains shrouded in deep mystery.",

    "abstract": "Data literacy skills are becoming critical in today’s world as the quantity of data grows exponentially and becomes the ‘currency’ of power. In spring 2020, a team of two librarians piloted a new one-credit course in data literacy and data visualisation. This report explains the rationale behind the project and discusses the place of data literacy within information literacy (IL) instruction. The authors describe the pilot’s learning objectives, topics covered, course design, the structure of assignments and the delivery of the course. They analyse the feedback received on the course and suggest ways to refine their practice. The article calls for a re-envisaging of the library’s role in data literacy instruction. It aims to address how librarians can extend their current practice of teaching IL to data literacy and why it is important. The authors’ experience may inspire other academic librarians to incorporate data literacy and data visualisation into their teaching practice. © 2021, CILIP Information Literacy Group.

    "abstract": "There is a lack of empirical as well as theoretical literature examining the ways that terrorism spreads across different regions over different historical periods. This chapter looks to address one aspect of this deficit in the scholarship by locating the interrelationship between regionalisation and terror in its historical context. In doing so, it will examine the limitations of thinking about the regionalisation of terror in historical terms as well as the ways that the historical method enables us to understand more clearly some of the main aspects of the issue. In particular, the chapter will assess the relationship between terrorism, history and regionalisation in terms of a number of distinct but overlapping factors: the connection between the nation state, non-state actors and the 'new' terrorism; and transnationalism and the contribution of region-specific factors in the formation, evolution and operational effectiveness of terror groups. Despite the absence of much relevant literature, these important issues will be placed in their historical context and will be examined in terms of their historical continuity as they relate to the regionalisation of terror.",

    "abstract": "Sellars inherits the Kantian idea that “to say that man is a rational animal, is to say that man is a creature not of habits, but of rules” (“Language, Rules and Behavior,” p. 298). For familiar Wittgensteinian reasons, conceptual activity cannot be rule-following activity. Sellars therefore articulates a via media between rule-following activity and mere rule-conforming behavior—something he calls pattern-governed behavior. The task is to explain how pattern-governed behavior is related to rules without being rule-following—and without assimilating it to mere rule-conforming behavior. The rules in question are those making explicit the language transitions that constitute the meaning of linguistic tokens. A key thing distinguishing pattern-governed behavior from mere rule-conforming behavior is a linguistic ‘superstructure’ containing, among other things, a metalanguage comprising these rules—material rules of inference making explicit normative proprieties implicit in pattern-governed behavior. Further, these norms implicit in pattern-governed behavior presuppose the existence of collective attitudes. It thus emerges that pattern-governed behavior must be understood as behavior in the we-mode in the strong sense (to use Tuomela’s language). Finally, the material rules of inference in the metalanguage are expressed using we-intentions; and so the very thing that separates pattern-governed from mere rule-conforming behavior—a metalanguage in which these rules are explicitly formulated—presupposes collective attitudes. Thus, on several different levels, pattern-governed behavior (and therefore conceptual activity—perhaps even sapience itself) presupposes collective attitudes. I conclude with some reflections on how these considerations point us toward an argument for the reality of the Sellarsian moral community. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

    "abstract": "What would world literature look like, if we stopped referring to the 'West'? Starting with the provocative premise that the ''West' is ten percent of the planet', World Literature Decentered is the first book to decenter Eurocentric discourses of global literature and global history - not just by deconstructing or historicizing them, but by actively providing an alternative. Looking at a series of themes across three literatures (Mexico, Turkey and Bengal), the book examines hotels, melancholy, orientalism, femicide and the ghost story in a series of literary traditions outside the 'West'. The non-West, the book argues, is no fringe group or token minority in need of attention - on the contrary, it constitutes the overwhelming majority of this world. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

    "abstract": "In 2018, Saudi Arabia and Netflix were forced to confront the limits of freedom of speech online. The kingdom requested that the streaming giant remove a critical episode of the satirical show Patriot Act with Hassan Minhaj from its local service, and the latter complied at the risk of reputational damage. Focusing on the controversy surrounding this case, this article explores how both state and business adopt and adapt to changes in technology and how each reasserts its sphere of influence in the digital era. We argue that state and business are developing a symbiotic relationship in the context of de-territorialized digital capitalism. Such a relationship allows both entities to engage in mutual interdependence that accommodates the interests of the other while avoiding harmful consequences and deleterious effects. In practice, the state exercises targeted censorship while businesses abide by controlled compliance. The account and analysis presented regarding the logic of symbiotic relationship draws attention to the various ways in which global media players in the digital era have navigated territoriality and the extent of state–business mutual accommodation. © The Author(s) 2020.",

    "abstract": "As the world is crippled by the novel coronavirus pandemic, countries across the Middle East are bracing for an unprecedented fallout. A region that continues to bear the brunt of many wars, conflicts, and authoritarian oppressions has been held hostage to an invisible virus rampaging through its nations, indiscriminately affecting and infecting all parts of their populations. Already dire socioeconomic situations in many of these countries have been exacerbated by the closure of workspaces and educational facilities, the concomitant rise in redundancies and unemployment, increased social and political frictions, decimation of markets, and a further plummeting of economies. As official livelihood structures crumble under the weight of increasingly impoverished and unsupported populations, the informality of life will only intensify across the Middle East, as it will elsewhere in the world. While informal networks of working, living, and socializing are crucial for the survival of disadvantaged communities across the Middle East, these have taken a direct hit from nation-wide and government-mandated closures and restrictions and increased digital surveillance. These measures, combined with public fears and safety concerns, have largely kept Middle Eastern populations at home and off the streets. It is only a matter of time before these predicaments become intolerable for the many already trying to endure in precarious environments, compelling collective anger and resentment to once again spill out into the open.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the only Turkish cinematic adaptation of Hamlet to date, entitled Kadin Hamlet: Intikam Melegi [Lady Hamlet: The Angel of Vengeance] (1976), which replaces the role of Hamlet with a strong and determined female character. It is set against the background of a modernizing Turkish state, but still within a culture that showed some resistance to such modernity. This study examines how the director employs certain motifs, devices, and strategies (such as the use of classical music or westernized styles of dressing) to forward a modernizing agenda for the film. In particular, the idea of longing for an absent father (Ataturk and Hamlet's father) and contempt for the various puppets which have replaced him in politics (represented by Claudius and Polonius) is a key aspect of this adaptation. The 1976 film is analysed here in a wider historical context of Turkish Hamlets that have been adapted, staged, and produced in different genres and media with the modernizing aims of the Kemalist state in mind. © 2021 Adile Aslan Almond.",

    "abstract": "Transitional justice practices in the Arab World have unfolded in ways that both reinforce the value of the critical turn in transitional justice while also underscoring its limitations. Used as both a tool of repression and of resistance, transitional justice practices in the Arab World mark a significant development in the field by expanding its dynamic processes across time and space. Ongoing violence and the resurgence of authoritarian rule have necessitated a transitional justice process that aims to help deliver on the revolutionary objectives of the Arab uprisings themselves: to uproot decades of structural oppression and authoritarian rule. This article begins with a brief review of the critical turn in transitional justice and how it presents questions, limitations, and opportunities with regard to key transitional justice practices in the Arab World. Next, it will examine how such practices have made the state and its institutions as object of transitional justice as opposed to its enforcer. The article will then address the potentials of universal jurisdiction as a transitional justice strategy that has just as much to do with a broader political project, such as weakening an authoritarian regime, as it does with the narrower goal of putting regime officials on trial. Finally, I argue that transitional justice in the Arab World is a tool of resistance to colonial and neo-colonial powers, making it an important engine of Third World Approaches to International Law praxis.",

    "abstract": "The Darfur conflict exploded in early 2003 when two rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement, struck national military installations in Darfur to send a hard-hitting message of resentment over the region’s political and economic marginalization. The conflict devastated the region’s economy, shredded its fragile social fabric, and drove millions of people from their homes. Darfur Allegory is a dispatch from the humanitarian crisis that explains the historical and ethnographic background to competing narratives that have informed international responses. At the heart of the book is Sudanese anthropologist Rogaia Abusharaf’s critique of the pseudoscientific notions of race and ethnicity that posit divisions between “Arab” northerners and “African” Darfuris. &#xa0; Elaborated in colonial times and enshrined in policy afterwards, such binary categories have been adopted by the media to explain the civil war in Darfur. The narratives that circulate internationally are thus highly fraught and cover over—to counterproductive effect—forms of Darfurian activism that have emerged in the conflict’s wake. Darfur Allegory marries the analytical precision of a committed anthropologist with an insider’s view of Sudanese politics at home and in the diaspora, laying bare the power of words to heal or perpetuate civil conflict.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the organisation of VOX, a new radical right party in Spain. It shows that the party has taken early and uneven steps to build a mass organisation and initially opted for open membership recruitment with participatory organisational elements. Also, the party's rapid growth and quick entrance into political institutions at different state levels led the party leadership to establish more centralised control and limit members' prerogatives, though recruitment continued. Centralisation in part responds to organisational needs given the party's quickly acquired political relevance, but also to the desire of the central party leadership to forestall the articulation of territorial interests, or prevent them from escaping their control. Today, VOX exhibits elements of mass party organisation and highly centralised decision-making in the hands of national party leaders. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",

    "abstract": "On 5 June 2017, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with the State of Qatar and initiated a blockade against the country. In this study, we provide the first in-depth examination of the impact the blockade had on Qatar’s economy and review the policy responses that followed. In particular, we consider how the policies that have since emerged either complemented or deviated from past policies and practices and evaluate whether they have in fact brought long-term benefits to the country –– benefits that may have not been realized had the blockade not taken place. Our review finds that the blockade did not cause a shift in policy direction, but it did change the urgency and process by which policies were put together and pushed forward, as well as their effectiveness. Furthermore, we find that the timing of the blockade worked in Qatar’s favor in surprising ways. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide both a meticulous documentation of the policy responses that followed the blockade and an in-depth analysis of its impact. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines some of the important ethical questions that emerged in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic in light of the various Muslim responses to this global emergency. It focuses on the ethical discussions concerning the main measures that have been taken to fight the disease, which can be divided into two main categories: preventive and therapeutic. The paper also addresses measures taken to handle the dead bodies of deceased patients in a proper and dignified manner, according to relevant Islamic norms. The paper traces the background of these discussions in classical normative discourses, with a particular focus on the issue of the plague and also the issue of medical treatment. The paper argues that Islamic responses to the Covid-19 pandemic echo a longstanding two-pronged moral concern in the Islamic normative tradition with regard to pandemic situations; namely, to balance: the religious and metaphysical dimensions of the scriptural sources with the practical implications of real incidents of plagues and pandemics; and the interests of individuals against the collective interests of groups and societies.",

Africa and the International System: The Politics of State Survival. Vol. 50. Cambridge University Press]. Despite the fact that, for more than five decades, Western aid agencies have been trying to improve and contribute to Africa's postcolonial development, today's development challenges in Africa remain eerily similar to those of the early 1960s. 2 This failure is often attributed to the fact that these Western aid institutions were not sensitive to local realities. Rather, these institutions tried to impose what they saw as ‘good governance’ modalities, such as privatisation, deregulation, and welfare reforms. As such, this article analyses how Moroccan policy makers are adamant on continuity rather than change when it comes to theorising new strategies of development aiming at modernising agriculture. This will serve the objective of drawing broader conclusions on the effects of different western-conceived development paradigms on developing nations that are not moving beyond the ideological and epistemological straightjacket of their colonial legacies. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "title": "Knowledge as a collective status",
    "abstract": "While social epistemology is a diverse field, much of it still understands knowledge as an individual status—albeit an individual status that crucially depends on various social factors (such as testimony). Further, the literature on group knowledge until now has primarily focused on limited, specialized groups that may be said to know this or that as a group. I wish to argue, to the contrary, that all knowledge attributions ascribe a collective status; and that this follows more or less directly from an essential function of entitlement-ascriptions: Ascriptions of knowledge and entitlement serve a primarily social function in that they facilitate coordination by maintaining consensus around true beliefs, true theories, and truth-producing methodologies. This conclusion will shed light on ways in which traditional theories of knowledge (such as foundationalism and coherentism) fail to capture a central function of our epistemic practice. © 2021 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Moments of infraction of international law can generate new law. These can also be important examples of contingency in the history of international law, if the process occurs as an unintended consequence of actors’ aims. The French Revolution was just such an instance. The transmission of sovereignty from the person of the king to the collective populace of France was a central feature of the Revolution. Unplanned by revolutionaries, the principle of popular sovereignty bled into international law and became a new justification for claims to territory—a precept which, by the twentieth century, came to be called national self-determination. This chapter explores how the will of the people became a force in international law, inadvertently from the perspective of revolutionaries, as a result of changing public opinion, claims of jurisprudential and moral legitimacy, and military force.",

    "abstract": "The talking animals that populate Zora Neale Hurston's fiction and folklore collections have often been read allegorically: as stand-ins for human beings, they upend Black people's oppressed symbolic status as dumb beasts and reveal them as agential subjects capable of speaking out of turn. I argue, however, that Hurston's mules, dogs, and buzzards serve as an imaginative resource for the encounter with difference not merely through their expressive capacities, but also through their very unknowability. Hurston's animals resist becoming objects of knowledge for a natural history practice that, at the time, was increasingly dominated by mechanistic accounts of animal behavior. Her work instead stages other species as partially illegible, opaque, and uncanny, suggesting ways that species difference becomes a source of imaginative resistance for racialized subjects, a bulwark against reductive explanations that render their behavior entirely transparent.

    "abstract": "This study presents an analysis of various facets of inequality in Egypt using a political economy approach to understand how inequalities are reproduced in the Egyptian economy. It examines the drivers of income and wealth inequality, and the impact of uneven taxation. The paper highlights how the mis-measurement of top incomes can skew the measurement of inequality, and shows how Egypt has one of the biggest wealth gaps in the world. It investigates educational, gender, and healthcare inequalities and how they are reproduced across generations. The paper also highlights the disparity between urban and rural areas, which further contributes to inequality. It assesses why economic growth in Egypt has had limited success in reducing poverty and inequality, and analyzes how state and military interference in markets hampers the growth of the private sector. The paper concludes by examining how inequality, combined with a number of challenges that Egypt is facing, including increased authoritarianism, climate change, demographic pressures, and water security will likely exacerbate many of the country's socioeconomic and political problems. Overall, the study argues that inequality remains a key concern that, if left unaddressed, may lead to social unrest and instability in the long term. © 2020 Hartford Seminary",

    "abstract": "Very little is known about the life experiences of highly skilled female migrants and almost nothing about them outside of Western contexts. This paper attempts to address this knowledge gap by examining the experiences of highly skilled migrant women working in the Persian Gulf monarchy of Qatar. Drawing on in-depth interviews with a sample of highly skilled migrants in Qatar, the paper examines the experiences of highly skilled migrant women in the Gulf in order to understand how their experiences compare with male counterparts, and the ways in which these experiences are gendered as a result of marital and family status. It also examines how the kafala labor sponsorship system differentially conditions highly skilled female versus male labor market participation, thereby producing very different professional and personal migration experiences. Finally, the paper highlights the importance of intersectionality on migrants' lived experiences, as it finds that social, cultural, national, and geographical categories are important when thinking about the mobility of highly skilled women.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines bioethical discourses concerning genetic counseling within the area of assisted reproduction. More particularly, it investigates the extent to which mainstream Western or secular bioethics is considered lacking from an Islamic perspective. The paper argues that invocation, incorporation, and even interrogation of Islamic norms ensure the legitimacy of genetic counseling within the Muslim context. The paper suggests a distinction between two levels of analysis within Islamic bioethical discussions on the consequences of genetic testing. The first addresses ethical-legal dimensions and is primarily concerned with balancing immediate benefits and harms in this world. The second addresses theological and metaphysical dimensions and is primarily concerned with faith-based convictions and religious commitments. The paper argues that both levels are needed for a nuanced understanding of the process of genetic counseling within a Muslim setting. The paper gives special attention to institutional fatwas on two main issues: prenatal genetic screening and preimplantation genetic diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Journal of Arabian Studies (JAS), this article offers the first history of the field of Gulf and Arabian Peninsula Studies (GAPS), including the origins and evolution of JAS. It begins with an overview of the origins and evolution of GAPS as a field of scholarship, then provides a detailed survey of the field’s institutional development, which can be traced back to the region’s post-war oil wealth and the large oil-funded archaeological expeditions of the 1950s–60s. This is reflected in GAPS’s first societies, centers, and journals, which catered exclusively to archaeologists, historians, and Arabists. The transformation of GAPS into a global interdisciplinary field (encompassing both humanities and social sciences) began in 1969, although it remained a fringe field within Middle East Studies. The expansion of GAPS into a mainstream field in its own right began in the 2000s, reaching critical mass in the 2010s, resulting in the establishment of the Association for Gulf and Arabian Peninsula Studies (AGAPS) and the launch of JAS. In the past decade, GAPS also expanded beyond Middle East Studies to embrace Indian Ocean Studies. The article concludes with an overview of JAS’s first decade: 2011–20.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses changing marriage practices in modern-day Qatar, drawing on empirical data gathered in a sociolegal study involving interviews with individual citizens and residents about their marriage and family experiences, and with legal personnel and experts in family law. It presents a unique insight into evolving relationship behaviours occurring within and on the periphery of Qatar's family-law framework in the context of its population make-up, historic traditions, trends in education, and globalisation. Changing practices examined include 'late' first marriages and 'marrying out.' The empirical research findings are used to analyse the link between the administrative process of obtaining permission to marry out and non-state-registered marriages, the gender imbalance in the treatment of those marrying out, and the link between child custody rights and unofficial marriages. The emerging narrative depicts couples navigating marriage laws and utilising non-state-registered 'religious-only' marriages as a temporary measure to overcome legal and administrative hindrances. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2020.",

The volume begins its examination of Ottoman rule in the Arabian Peninsula, exploring other dimensions of the region's history up until and after independence in the 1960s and 1970s. Featuring scholars from a range of disciplines, the book demonstrates how the Persian Gulf's current, complex politics is a product of interwoven dynamics rooted in historical developments and memories, profound social, cultural, and economic changes underway since the 1980s and the 1990s, and inter-state and international relations among both regional actors and between them and the rest of the world. The book comprises a total of 36 individual chapters divided into the following six sections: Historical Context Society and Culture Economic Development Domestic Politics Regional Security Dynamics The Persian Gulf and the World Examining the Persian Gulf's increasing importance in regional politics, diplomacy, economics, and security issues, the volume is a valuable resource for scholars, students, and policy makers interested in political science, history, Gulf studies, and the Middle East.",

    "abstract": "The institution of the state in the Middle East, including even those territorial states whose roots go back only to the Western presence, are of much greater importance than recent scholarship would suggest. Furthermore, following the outbreak of the “Arab Spring” in the winter of 2010, which degenerated into widespread regional turmoil, questions of religious affiliation, family and clan, ethnic communal, and tribal identity generated renewed interest, especially in regard to their interaction with the institution of the state. The violence that erupted in 2010–11 destabilized the unity of some of the states in the region and led to the collapse of others. This article addresses four recent books that attempt to grapple with the nature of the state in the Arab world and the attenuation of the regional order in the Middle East.",

    "abstract": "This article traces the introduction of cinema to the Gulf through the archives of the India Office Records (IOR). The records of the political agent in Bahrain illustrate clearly the extent to which cinema was closely monitored and regulated by the British colonial network of administrative functions in the Persian Gulf, India, and England. Following the discovery of oil in 1932, hydrocarbon modernity gave rise to new spaces of urban culture, most prominently cinema. But in the oil cities of the Gulf, film spectatorship in its early years was refracted through three spheres of moving-image culture: private, corporate-sponsored, and commercial public cinemas. What was common to these three spheres was a certain logic of exclusion and restricted access norms. Administrators in the Gulf looked to how cinema was handled in India for models and ideas to create actual policies on the ground. The bureaucratic traffic over the case of early public cinema petitions in Bahrain shows how regulatory practices and norms of governance over cinematic spheres circulated from one colonial context (South Asia) to another (the Gulf). The core political issue of the emergence of a cinema culture in the Gulf was the restriction of cinematic medium and space to certain populations. As such, regulating cinema was linked to the question of managing the social forces of hydrocarbon modernity that the discovery of oil unleashed. The arrival of cinema in the Gulf took place in an exclusionary and uneven world, entangled with circulations of colonial practices, regimes of segregation, expansionist oil capital, international labor, and film cans. © 2020 Indiana University Press.

It shows that law reform is needed in the light of new and evolving relationship norms and the poor outcomes on relationship breakdown for all cohabiting couples, including those in religious-only marriages. It considers legal solutions which fall broadly within two categories: (1) amend wedding laws to facilitate simpler procedures for legal recognition thereby encouraging more couples to legally marry; and (2) extend family law rights available to all legally recognised couples to include those in cohabiting relationships.",

    "abstract": "This article compares and constrasts the responses of Australia, Canada, Germany, and the United States to the COVID-19 outbreak and spread. The pandemic has posed special challenges to these federal systems. Although federal systems typically have many advantages—they can adapt policies to local conditions, for example, and experiment with different solutions to problems—pandemics and people cross regional borders, and controlling contagion requires a great deal of national coordination and intergovernmental cooperation. The four federal systems vary in their relative distribution of powers between regional and national governments, in the way that health care is administered, and in the variation in policies across regions. We focus on the early responses to COVID-19, from January through early May 2020. Three of these countries—Australia, Canada, and Germany—have done well in the crisis. They have acted quickly, done extensive testing and contact tracing, and had a relatively uniform set of policies across the country. The United States, in contrast, has had a disastrous response, wasting months at the start of the virus outbreak, with limited testing, poor intergovernmental cooperation, and widely divergent policies across the states and even within some states. The article seeks to explain both the relative uniform responses of these three very different federal systems, and the sharply divergent response of the United States. © The Author(s) 2020.",

However, both small states have responded very differently to the causes and consequences of instability in the Gulf region and developed very different foreign policies to deal with their structural IR problem. Just how divergent their external relations now are is clearly seen in the UAE’s lead role in the diplomatic boycott and economic embargo launched against Qatar in June 2017—including the de facto dissolution of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Framing our examination in the theoretical literature on small states, we explain the ultimately colliding foreign policy trajectories of the UAE and Qatar in terms of diverging ideational and strategic considerations in the cause of what we term ‘overcoming smallness’. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "The complex interrelation between orthographic and phonological aspects in L2 learning pose different linguistic and pedagogical challenges. However, this paper focuses on the orthographic phonological-based errors resulting of this relationship and tries to explain these errors committed by learners, since Arabic and English have different phonological systems. For this purpose, a study was conducted on a corpus of about 250 pages generated by the written production of sixty-one English-speaking A1 learners of Arabic as a second language (acc. CEFR) at the Manchester Metropolitan University to examine how the phonological competence at the early stages of learning Arabic reflects on their orthographic production. It is hoped that the results of this study will provide answers for linguist researchers and educationists alike.",

What exactly does it mean to “reverse the gaze” and include the Orientalist within the frame of representation? The article considers the non-Western representation of Orientalists and Orientalism in literary texts from three different regions (Turkey, Mexico, and Bengal), concentrating in particular on Oguz Atay's Tutunamayanlar (The Disconnected), Ignacio Padilla's Antipodes, and Amitav Ghosh’s In an Antique Land, but also referring to a wide selection of other texts in the process. It suggests three categories of such representation — parodic, empathetic, and authoritative, in ascending order of sympathy — and proposes, in the analysis of the various fictitious representations of Orientalists examined, a central link between Orientalism and the sacred. Finally, the question of the ironic representation of Orientalists — the extent to which a redemptive irony is adopted by structures of power as a tool of self-preservation — is also considered. © The Author(s) 2020.",

The volume begins its examination of Ottoman rule in the Arabian Peninsula, exploring other dimensions of the region's history up until and after independence in the 1960s and 1970s. Featuring scholars from a range of disciplines, the book demonstrates how the Persian Gulf's current, complex politics is a product of interwoven dynamics rooted in historical developments and memories, profound social, cultural, and economic changes underway since the 1980s and the 1990s, and inter-state and international relations among both regional actors and between them and the rest of the world. The book comprises a total of 36 individual chapters divided into the following six sections: Historical Context Society and Culture Economic Development Domestic Politics Regional Security Dynamics The Persian Gulf and the World Examining the Persian Gulf's increasing importance in regional politics, diplomacy, economics, and security issues, the volume is a valuable resource for scholars, students, and policy makers interested in political science, history, Gulf studies, and the Middle East. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Mehran Kamrava.

OEPs identify three main issues that affect their ability to do their job well: unscrupulous recruiters and companies based in the Gulf who use the issuance of labour contracts to extract profits from migrants and Pakistani recruiters; a lack of support both from the Pakistani and Saudi Arabian state to address core issues that hamper migrants' success; and the challenge of mediating long-distance on behalf of their migrant-clients once they are working in the Gulf.",

    "abstract": "The Persian Gulf suffers from chronic insecurity. This insecurity is the result of two complementary developments. First, the American-engineered security architecture—which is designed to marginalize Iran and is meant to directly and indirectly deepen America’s military presence in the region—is itself a major source of insecurity. Second, preoccupation with military dimensions of security overlook equally important elements of human security, which have hitherto been largely ignored by scholars of the Persian Gulf as well as by regional policymakers. Despite increased militarization of the region, in fact because of it, the Persian Gulf is likely to remain insecure so long as threats to human security, such as identity, natural resources, and employment persist.",

    "abstract": "Oil has seriously impacted the institutional development of the state in the Arabian Peninsula. More specifically, the sudden and unprecedented acquisition of massive oil revenues resulted in the freezing of the state's formal and informal institutions, at the point at which petrodollars were injected into the state's coffers. From then on, state leaders were able to deploy the state's wealth to dictate the pace and direction of institutional change. Over time, any institutional change has been directed towards enhancing regime security, and the pace of change has been calculated and deliberately slow. Any political opening has been dictated by the logic of state power maximization (in relation to society). At the same time, partly to ensure its popular legitimacy and partly through the vision of its leaders, the state has deployed its massive wealth both to foster rapid economic and infrastructural development, and to enhance the living standards of its citizens. In other words, whereas oil may have stunted institutional development -- i.e., an institution's curse -- it has been an economic blessing.",

    "abstract": "The six oil monarchies of the Persian Gulf together form one of the most concentrated global sites of international labor migration, with some of the highest densities of non-citizens to citizens seen anywhere in the world. A somewhat unique feature of the region is that while it hosts millions of migrants, it allows almost no access to permanent settlement. Gulf States have hosted large cohorts of migrants for more than half a century but have done so without efforts toward formal integration through citizenship. Although labor migration as a phenomenon is both permanent and prominent, the Gulf States’ mechanism for governing migration systematically reinforces the temporariness and transience of their migrant populations.",

    "abstract": "In her article, 'Islamic Legal Studies: A Critical Historiography,' published in The Oxford Handbook of Islamic Law, Ayesha Chaudhry criticizes the field of Islamic law, and Islamic studies more broadly, for promoting two hegemonic methodologies: White Supremacist Islamic Studies and Patriarchal Islamic Studies. She argues that these modes of scholarship perpetuate patriarchy, decenter Muslim narratives, privilege precolonial texts, and create barriers to entry into academia. Her resolution is a new form of Islamic studies-Intersectional Islamic Studies-which seeks to recenter Muslim narratives, is committed to social justice, and exposes the problematic power structures within academic inquiry. Chaudhry argues that scholarship produced using the first two methods is 'bad scholarship,' whereas scholarship produced using the third method is 'good scholarship.' In this article, I problematize the dichotomy between 'good' and 'bad' scholarship and argue that Chaudhry's methodology is restrictive, hegemonic, and detrimental to meaningful scholarly engagement. © 2020 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "This paper discusses European policies towards the Qatar crisis in the context of the evolution of broader past and present European policies towards the Gulf. It starts with a summary discussion of historical patterns of relations between Europe and the Gulf, before briefly sketching the major changes in the regional environment after the Second World War, beginning with the US supplanting the UK as the dominant hegemon, through to the changes wrought by Trump’s elevation to the US presidency. It then turns to a discussion of the effects of these changes for the Gulf and other regional states and their policy postures, before going on to examine the ways in which European states and the EU have interpreted and reacted to this changing environment. These reactions are often at one and the same time a reaction to the changes and uncertainties in US policy under Trump, since this changing US role is also a crucial ingredient both in the region and for Europe’s room for manoeuvre. Against this background, the paper will outline European policies towards the Gulf theater in particular, focusing on Iran and the JCPOA nuclear deal, and the GCC (or Qatar) crisis -- while also briefly considering the Yemen crisis and the impact of Gulf competition on and in the Libyan theater. From October 2018, the Khashoggi affair added an additional dimension to the crisis, as did the renewed oil price crash amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic beginning in 2020. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

The volume begins its examination of Ottoman rule in the Arabian Peninsula, exploring other dimensions of the region's history up until and after independence in the 1960s and 1970s. Featuring scholars from a range of disciplines, the book demonstrates how the Persian Gulf's current, complex politics is a product of interwoven dynamics rooted in historical developments and memories, profound social, cultural, and economic changes underway since the 1980s and the 1990s, and inter-state and international relations among both regional actors and between them and the rest of the world. The book comprises a total of 36 individual chapters divided into the following six sections: Historical Context Society and Culture Economic Development Domestic Politics Regional Security Dynamics The Persian Gulf and the World Examining the Persian Gulf's increasing importance in regional politics, diplomacy, economics, and security issues, the volume is a valuable resource for scholars, students, and policy makers interested in political science, history, Gulf studies, and the Middle East.",

However, both small states have responded very differently to the causes and consequences of instability in the Gulf region and developed very different foreign policies to deal with their structural IR problem. Just how divergent their external relations now are is clearly seen in the UAE’s lead role in the diplomatic boycott and economic embargo launched against Qatar in June 2017—including the de facto dissolution of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Framing our examination in the theoretical literature on small states, we explain the ultimately colliding foreign policy trajectories of the UAE and Qatar in terms of diverging ideational and strategic considerations in the cause of what we term ‘overcoming smallness’. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Voters punish incumbent Presidential candidates for contractions in the county-level supply of mortgage credit during market-wide contractions of credit, but do not reward them for expansions in mortgage credit supply in boom times. Our primary focus is the Presidential election of 2008, which followed an unprecedented swing from very generous mortgage underwriting standards to a severe contraction of mortgage credit. Voters responded to the credit crunch by shifting their support away from the Republican Presidential candidate in 2008. That shift was large and particularly pronounced in states that typically vote Republican, and in swing states. Without it McCain would have received half the votes needed in nine crucial swing states to reverse the outcome of the election. We extend our analysis to the Presidential elections from 1996 to 2012 and find that voters only react to contractions, not expansions, of credit, and reactions are similar for Democratic and Republican incumbent parties. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

This paper extends a standard Armington trade model to incorporate an oligopolistically competitive transportation industry in which shippers endogenously choose a transportation technology. I collect detailed data on the containerized maritime transportation industry to calibrate the parameters of the model. I then conduct quantitative experiments in which there is a symmetric increase in tariffs. On average, changes in transportation costs account for almost half of the changes in welfare. These findings suggest that the endogeneity of transportation costs is an important mechanism determining the welfare effects of such a policy change. © 2019",

    "abstract": "Doha, once a sleepy Indian Ocean port and now a symbol of Qatar's rise as a petro-state, is a city divided between its wealth citizens and resident aliens and the migrant workers that serve them. The city's spatial divisions are rooted in its transoceanic history as much as its makeover as an urban experiment in authoritarian modernism (Hashim, Irazabal, and Byrum 2010). As Qatar's monarchical regime liberalized its economy with an eye to the post-hydrocarbon future (Nonneman 2006), Doha came to be defined by imposing edifices towering over awestruck subjects and a lack of public spaces and street corners in which different strata of society can mingle or gather freely. With the arrival of COVID-19, the well-planned residential neighborhoods of wealthy citizens and expatriates seem starkly separated from those of the working poor even as their dependence on each other is arguably greater than ever before. This deeply divided city, wrestling with the politics of contagion, shows how logics of exclusion and interdependence are, paradoxically, intertwined inextricably.",

    "abstract": "This article examines Saudi Arabia's decision in recent years to use novel and hitherto unexplored informal alliance formats, which we term multinational security coalitions (MSCs). This development was initiated by the new Saudi political leadership under King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who have a much greater inclination to pursue proactive foreign and security policies than their predecessors. However, it will be highlighted that beyond the priorities of individual personalities, this shift in Saudi Arabia's behaviour occurred against the backdrop of significant changes in the existing security environment, including the perceived withdrawal of the United States from the security affairs of the region during the presidency of Barack Obama, and crucially also Saudi Arabia's frustration over the failure of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to develop into a viable security mechanism. The article begins with the introduction of the key ideas relating to institutional design, the conceptual framework for this study. Section two outlines the most important reasons for Saudi Arabia's choice of the MSC format. The third section examines the strengths of the MSC format-especially informality, the resulting low entry-thresholds and the low risk of entrapment-that provided Saudi Arabia with partial and temporary success in recruiting coalition partners and thus bolstering its leadership role. The final section demonstrates, however, that ultimately MSCs are not a panacea. The informality of MSCs that makes it easy for the pivotal state to assemble a coalition also makes it hard for it to forge, and enforce, a common vision.",

    "abstract": "In January 2020, the Russian-language bimonthly “Russia in Global Affairs” published an article on “memory politics” and related conflicts, following a roundtable hosted by the magazine (Rossiya, 2020). To our amazement, the discussion caused a very keen reaction, especially in Europe. Our modest publication was immediately dubbed as nearly a forge of Kremlin ideas regarding “memory wars,” which, of course, is flattering, but, alas, is not true. In general, the willingness to see behind everything a conspiracy of dark forces and the belief that everything happens for a reason, well-known to us from our own history, have now spectacularly become commonplace. So, since the topic triggered such a powerful response, we decided to take it further by asking members of the academic community in different countries how they assess the current state of affairs in “memory politics.” They came up with a very broad range of opinions, which we gladly share with our readers. © 2020, Foreign Policy Research Foundation.

    "abstract": "The objective of this article is to analyse the costs of responsible governance on the national political establishment of the Eurozone in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Our analysis tests two main hypotheses. First, we argue that financial crises like the one unleashed by the global financial meltdown of 2008 have an asymmetric impact on the electoral records of establishment parties depending on whether the countries affected by the financial crisis were financially intervened in or not. Our second hypothesis states that externally imposed austerity affects Left and Right national establishment parties differently. By choosing to act responsibly, that is, assuming the conditions of the intervention, the establishment Left pays a much larger electoral price than the one paid by the establishment Right under the same circumstances. To test our argument, we use a panel data set of 12 countries from the Eurozone in the period between 1999 (stage III of the monetary union) and 2015 that contains 54 country-election-year observations. Our findings show strong support for our two hypotheses. © The Author(s) 2018.",

This chapter will examine the evolution of Gulf labour migration policies, contentious areas which have come under criticism by proponents of migrant workers’ rights, and current reforms that are underway.",

    "abstract": "While media has thrived in Qatar since the 1990s, attempts at creating a systematic film industry have only recently come into being with the establishment of Northwestern University in Qatar and the Doha Film Institute. This chapter highlights how the creation of a local Qatari film industry presents one facet of a larger strategic national agenda of representing Qatari national identity—one that is scripted, edited, packaged, and exhibited. Even as the film industry purports to commit to film what it means to be Qatari, the country’s extraordinary demographic makeup, 88 percent of which is foreign, will necessarily be reflected in the workforce of this industry as well as in the creative content of the films being produced. Even as they are in service of promoting Qatari culture, these cosmopolitan cinematic collaborations serve to create connections between the different communities and encourage a hybrid merging of disparate cultural knowledge. This chapter shows how the budding Qatari film industry answers to, complicates, or negates the overarching national vision.",

    "abstract": "The Kafala Status Quo While the practice of kafala has historical roots in the Islamic world and in the pearl diving industry, today it is the central institution through which migrants are accounted for across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC, including Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE).4 Nearly all foreigners find themselves subject to this sponsorship system in some way, which amounts to roughly 85 percent of Qatar's 2.6 million residents.5 The most pronounced feature of this system is that it ties each foreign worker directly to a specific employer-sponsor (kafeel), who may be a company or private citizen. Very quickly, international scrutiny of the migrant situation increased and a number of human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International, issued reports painting a dire picture of workers living in squalid conditions, being denied payment, and having passports confiscated.8 There were even reports of worker deaths associated with World Cup building sites due to construction accidents or health issues from working in extreme heat.9 After 2010, the international community saw the kafala system as an urgent question of safeguarding basic human rights. The sponsor acts as the official interlocutor between migrant and state, but this system has been widely accused of institutionalizing structural dependence and a dangerous imbalance of power.12 Most of the criticism lodged falls into two closely related camps: first, the sponsors wield substantial power to limit an employee's freedom of movement, and second, workers find themselves vulnerable to abuse and mistreatment.13 For example, although not legally allowed, confiscation of passports for the duration of the worker's contract is fairly common.14 In one of the first large-scale survey studies of 1,189 lowincome labor migrants in Qatar, Gardner et al. report that the passports of 90 percent of respondents were in their employers' possession.15 Similarly troubling is the failure of employers to provide or renew a residence permit (QID), without which a migrant is considered illegal and highly vulnerable. According to the same survey, 7 percent of low-income respondents were not in possession of a valid QID.",

    "abstract": "This article advances an alternative approach to the academic dispute over the legacy of the eighteenth-century Sufi and scholar Shāh Walī Allāh of Delhi (d. 1762 CE). It shows that largely as the consequence of a Weberian teleology of modernization, Orientalism, and nationalism, works on Shāh Walī Allāh produced between the 1940s and 1980s overwhelmingly considered him a progenitor of modern Islam in South Asia. Although some scholars continue to assert the same into the present, the influence of post-modern critical theory since the 1980s has refined the argument about Shāh Walī Allāh's legacy in various ways but has also led to the rise of another current of scholarship that denies him any substantive legacy, largely because he worked in an environment free of European influence. Common to such scholarship are assumptions about Shāh Walī Allāh's motivations with respect to his policy of Islamic reform. Critical of such an approach, this article turns from the debate about his motivations to the agreed-upon implications of his thought relative to the eighteenth-century intellectual and social context in which he lived. On this basis, this article finds that Shāh Walī Allāh's legacy has been extensive in the modern period insofar as the latter-day South Asian thinkers who reference him - whether Sufi, fundamentalist, or modernist - attempt to follow through on his principles.",

    "abstract": "This essay sketches some of the main characteristics of a perennial and cross-civilizational concept of wisdom. It argues that the latter is based upon a strong and deep sense of transcendence, and upon the discernment that flows from it. This essay highlights the ways in which this discriminative wisdom does not amount to any form of dualism, but, on the contrary, leads its proponents and practitioners to an all-encompassing experience of anthropocosmic harmony and metaphysical unity. Taking stock of Asian wisdom traditions such as Advaita Vedanta and Zen Buddhism, this paper also stresses the intimate connection between wisdom and objectivity; hence, the ideal of a full attentiveness to reality in its irreducible suchness. Finally, the essay broaches wisdom's power of intellectual and spiritual displacement as a means of realizing the aforementioned objectivity. The final section discusses the circumstantial and ontological reasons for wisdom's concealment, and the ways in which sagely expressions must be adjusted to a wide spectrum of human limitations.",

    "abstract": "The book explores how across the Arabian Peninsula, oil wealth began accruing to the state at a particular juncture in the state-building process, when traditional, largely informal patterns of shaikhly rule were relatively well established, but the formal institutional apparatuses of the state were not yet fully formed. The chapters show that oil wealth had a direct impact on subsequent developments in these two complementary areas. Contributors discuss how on one hand, the distribution of petrodollars enabled political elites to solidify existing patterns of rule through deepening clientelist practices and by establishing new, dependent clients; and how on the other, rent revenues gave state leaders the opportunity to establish and shape institutions in ways that solidified their political control.",

Unlike the position in the United States, in China the prices of goods tend to be lower in larger cities. We explain that difference between the countries by the more uneven spatial distribution of manufacturers' sales and retailers in China, and we confirm the pro-competitive effect of city size on reducing markups there. In both countries, there is a greater variety of goods in larger cities, but that effect is more pronounced in China. Combining the lower prices and greater variety, the price indexes in China for the goods we study fall with city size by around seven times more than in the United States. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

This article grapples with the inevitable linkages between prayer and power in African Pentecostalism. It argues for a limit-transcending paradigm that connects prayer and praxis. In order to fully come to terms with God's prophetic mandate, African Pentecostal congregations must embrace a theological profile that celebrates both orthodoxy and orthopraxis. The article proposes that the dysfunctional role of religion in Africa rests on a binary model that intentionally creates a separation between present and futuristic eschatology, between the noumenal and the phenomena, and between the earth and the ethereal.",

    "abstract": "The historical use of sport for political purposes is well documented. Since the early twentieth century, many states have shaped their national sport policies to support broader domestic and foreign policy agendas. However, while sport policy scholars, in particular, have developed descriptive accounts of disparate approaches to sport policymaking, relatively little attention has been paid to identifying the factors that explain this variance. As a consequence, the variables that influence and constrain state choice when it comes to sport policy remain underspecified. This project addresses this deficit in the current literature by exploring how political regime type influences sport policy development. The analysis compares the recent sport policies of three countries which differ on the basis of regime type: an autocracy (Qatar), a partial democracy (Lebanon), and a full democracy (United Kingdom). While there is tentative evidence to support the widely held notion that states ‘use’ sport for similar purposes, this comparative survey reveals that the policy approaches and efficacy likely vary on the basis of regime type, and argues that this variable should be more explicitly considered in future sport policy research. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

The volume begins its examination of Ottoman rule in the Arabian Peninsula, exploring other dimensions of the region's history up until and after independence in the 1960s and 1970s. Featuring scholars from a range of disciplines, the book demonstrates how the Persian Gulf's current, complex politics is a product of interwoven dynamics rooted in historical developments and memories, profound social, cultural, and economic changes underway since the 1980s and the 1990s, and inter-state and international relations among both regional actors and between them and the rest of the world. The book comprises a total of 36 individual chapters divided into the following six sections: Historical Context Society and Culture Economic Development Domestic Politics Regional Security Dynamics The Persian Gulf and the World Examining the Persian Gulf's increasing importance in regional politics, diplomacy, economics, and security issues, the volume is a valuable resource for scholars, students, and policy makers interested in political science, history, Gulf studies, and the Middle East.",

    "abstract": "Since Qatar launched its gas strategy in the mid-1990s it has transitioned from an economic and political backwater into a relatively significant small state actor in the international system. In these few decades, this tiny country has established itself as a key player in the global financial, investment and property markets. In 2010, it became the world’s number one expoTrter of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). Over the same period, it also established itself as a diplomatic player with a pro-active and multidimensional, not to mention controversial, foreign policy engagement across the Arab and wider Muslim world. This paper will examine Qatar’s rise as a global gas power since the 1990s in terms of the country’s evolving strategic vision. In particular, it will assess the centrality of gas power to the decision of policy elites since the late 1990s to prioritize long-term strategic positioning over short-term stability. Finally, it will conclude with an assessment of the ways in which Qatar has used its gas power since the launch of the embargo against it in June 2017 to achieve its strategic objectives at a time of rapid change in the regional security system and the global energy market. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "Numerous critics have revisited the Turkish exile of 'the founding fathers' of humanist philology, Erich Auerbach and Leo Spitzer, in the period between the rise of Nazism in Germany and the end of World War II. Yet these recuperative analyses have been centered on the role of the experience of cultural displacement in the intellectual transformation of the émigré scholars. By contrast, this article offers a critical analysis of how the Turkish end of humanism (especially in the case of Auerbach and Spitzer's students) was entangled with the politics of Kemalist cultural reforms. If comparative literature was 'invented' during the Istanbul exile of Spitzer and Auerbach, this article re-writes this invention process by highlighting the semantic and ideological inflections it took in the hands of the Turkish humanists. © 2018 Copyright 2018 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the three major cities of the Persian Gulf region — Doha, Abu Dhabi, and Dubai. At the regional level, all three cities have become transportation hubs, and Doha and Abu Dhabi have become educational and cultural centers. At the global level, however, only Dubai has succeeded in becoming a key node in international networks of finance, commerce, services, telecommunications, logistics, and transportation. The others’ aspirations to become global cities are undermined by continued reliance on oil and gas revenues. On balance, while these cities are comparatively successful regional hubs, their long-term position as global cities is far from certain. © Middle East Institute.",

It examines the political careers of the first African women in colonial Kenya to be nominated to Kenya’s colonial-era LEGCO (Legislative Council). They were nominees of the country’s governor. The process that led to their nominations was neither transparent nor consultative, their terms were short and the extent to which they fostered broader working alliances with women outside the LEGCO was equally limited. These were the consequences of a nomination process that served the cosmetic interests of the state in the absence of a bolder effort to address the lack of women in the LEGCO, and the broader structural problems that cultivated gender inequalities which were then manifested in the low-level of women’s involvement in the country’s political arena. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "In 1869, the British allowed Muslims to sit as judges on the High Court. This article explores the legal opinions of the first Muslim judge to be appointed to the High Court, Syed Mahmood. Straddling two competing worlds - that of Cambridge University and that of his native India - Justice Mahmood both legitimated and resisted colonial judicial power. In this essay I will demonstrate how British judges interpreted points of Islamic law within an English legal framework, and how these interpretations contradicted their translated texts of Islamic law, yet became the foundation of legal precedents established through the doctrine of stare decisis. Despite participating within the British colonial judiciary, Mahmood challenged these precedents, demonstrating his ability to navigate the paradoxes of colonial power to secure for himself a legitimate platform from which he could argue his juridical interventions. The efficacy of these challenges, however, ultimately was restrained by the institutions and structures of the colonial jural project. © 2019 Brill Academic Publishers. All rights reserved.",

Results indicate that married women in patrilocal households are less likely to participate in economic and health-care decisions and have limited freedom of movement but also face less domestic abuse. By comparing outcomes for daughters-in-law and unmarried daughters of heads of household, the effect can be attributed to a discriminatory attitude toward women married into the family. Various robustness checks show that results are not driven by selection into type of postmarital residence. © 2018 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "This chapter examines the relationship between bioethics and the broader conceptualization of Islamic law under its Arabic counterpart and historically loaded term of Shariʿah. It explores some illustrative examples of premodern juristic discussions concerning medical questions and also examines modern juristic deliberations on bioethical dilemmas. The chapter discusses a sample of biomedical issues that shows the role of Islamic law in the formulation of Islamic normative rulings on some important bioethical issues. Considering the classical role of Islamic law in the definition of Islamic ethics, if not Islam itself, as well as the comprehensive scope of Islamic legal rules, bioethics in the Muslim context has largely consisted in ethical-legal assessment. The impact of modern medical technology on the classical corpus of Islamic law has not been limited to particular substantive issues but it has also included its procedural dimensions as well. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Khaled Abou El Fadl, Ahmad Atif Ahmad, and Said Fares Hassan; individual chapters, the contributors.",

    "abstract": "Most studies on the mobility of highly skilled migrants have been examined with a framework of global talent mobility and under conditions of neoliberal governance and economic globalization. In this study we challenge the notion of the hypermobile knowledge worker. Utilizing mixed methods, we examine the factors that attracted highly skilled migrants to Qatar and the conditions under which they might leave in the future. Rather than finding a group of footloose migrants attracted primarily to high-wage jobs, a lack of taxation or amenities, and with multiple alternative locations of residence, we find that highly skilled migrants exist on a spectrum of immobility. More significantly, this immobility depends on the migrant’s region of origin. For Asian and Western migrants immobility is attributed to the Kafala system or employer sponsorship, which hinders occupational and spatial mobility and ties workers to their sponsors. Arab highly skilled migrants are especially affected by lack of security and stability in their home countries, which makes these workers involuntarily immobile. The former group seem to be willing to accept a reduced level of agency and mobility for high income, whereas for the latter security and stability are more fundamental to their decision to come to Qatar. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "The importance of cooperative behavior in business environments has been theorized in the field of management. However, measuring cooperation quantitatively is often challenging. We take advantage of experimental methods to overcome this issue. Particularly, we study the decisions that small-scale entrepreneurs in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, make in a laboratory property rights dilemma experiment, comparing these to the decisions of student counterparts in the same and other countries, and looking for correlations between lab decisions and success in real-world business sales. We find that Mongolian entrepreneurs generally achieve much higher cooperation levels and hence higher experimental earnings than Mongolian students. Also, among individual participants, producing and desisting from theft in the lab setting is correlated at the 1% level with real-world business sales. Our findings align with the view that cooperative impulses or abidance of social norms can be an advantage in business relationships. © 2019 by the Southern Economic Association",

    "abstract": "We study how voters’ turnout decisions affect the turnout decisions of other voters by exploiting the unique staggered nature of India's elections. Voting takes places in several phases, with constituencies quasi-randomly assigned to phases. At the time that later phases vote, turnout in earlier phases is public knowledge but results are not. Using an instrumental variables strategy, we find that a 1 percentage point (pp)increase in turnout in the previous phase depresses turnout in the current phase by around 0.38 pp. Falsification tests examining the effect on turnout, of either constituencies in the same phase or in future phases in the same election, produce no effect. Our results are broadly consistent with pivotal voter and ethical voter models, and suggest that partial equilibrium evaluations of turnout interventions may overstate general equilibrium effects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",

    "abstract": "Scholars and policymakers, struggling to make sense of the ongoing chaos in the Middle East, have focused on the possible causes of the escalation in both inter-state and intra-state conflict. But the Arab Spring has shown the urgent need for new ways to frame difference, both practically and theoretically. For some, a fundamental incompatibility between different ethno-linguistic and religious communities lies at the root of these conflicts; these divisions are thought to impede any form of political resolution or social cohesion. But little work has been done to explore how these tensions manifest themselves in the communities of the Middle East. Sites of Pluralism fills this significant gap, going beyond a narrow focus on 'minorities' to examine the larger canvas of community politics in the Middle East. Through eight case studies from esteemed experts in law, education, history, architecture, anthropology and political science, this multi-disciplinary volume offers a critical view of the Middle East's diverse, pluralistic fabric: how it has evolved throughout history; how it influences current political, economic and social dynamics; and what possibilities it offers for the future.",

The domain of legal implementation has been one of the important contexts illustrating the role of custom in the continued process of legal construction, as demonstrated in the fatwa and judgeship literature. To begin with, knowledge of and familiarity with custom has been one of the important qualifications of a competent mufti or judge. Turning to the question of the authority of custom, it can be explored in two main contexts. The first investigates the textual evidence invoked to support and justify its legitimacy. The second investigates its relationship to other legal sources, especially in cases of conflict. Starting with textual sources, the jurists make a distinction between a concurrent or contemporaneous custom and a subsequent one. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Khaled Abou El Fadl, Ahmad Atif Ahmad, and Said Fares Hassan; individual chapters, the contributors.",

    "abstract": "Although its beginnings can be traced back to the late 19th century, the interfaith movement has only recently begun to attract mainstream attention, with governments, religious leaders and grassroots activists around the world increasingly turning to interfaith dialogue and collective action to address the challenges posed and explore the opportunities presented by religious diversity in a globalising world. This volume explores the history and development of the interfaith movement by engaging with new theoretical perspectives and a diverse range of case studies from around the world. The first book to bring together experts in the fields of religion, politics and social movement theory to offer an in-depth social analysis of the interfaith movement, it not only sheds new light on the movement itself, but challenges the longstanding academic division of labour that confines ‘religious’ and ‘social’ movements to separate spheres of inquiry. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, John Fahy and Jan-Jonathan Bock.",

    "abstract": "The small Gulf state of Qatar is today home to as many Christians, and as many Hindus, as it is Qatari citizens, making it one of the most religiously diverse states in the Middle East. A somewhat unintended consequence of the developmental trajectory Qatar has embarked on, like other emergent social realities religious diversity poses a threat to the identity of both the state and the small citizen population, and must be managed. This article explores how the state is responding to the challenge of religious diversity by looking at ‘Church city’, a recently built complex that houses several Christian churches on the outskirts of Doha. I argue that efforts to manage religious diversity are informed by notions of protection and segregation, as can be identified both in Islamic historical precedents, and in the state’s broader response to its developmental dilemma. © 2018, © 2018 British Society for Middle Eastern Studies.",

This article argues that no first-best solution to the problem exists, and that the belief in a first-best solution systematically disadvantages the least powerful people in political, social, and economic terms. The article then presents an alternative theory called “justice as the pursuit of accord” with a second-best approach. Assuming no all social contracts are insider-outsider contracts, can anything justify a social structure? The article suggests and explains three requirements for justification under these circumstances: the widest-possible accord (literal rather than hypothetical agreement), the minimum negative impact on people who cannot be brought into accord, and constant striving for greater accord. © 2019 Presses de Sciences Po.

The first section of the chapter discusses the labour market effects of the NIT experiments of the 1970s; the second section non-labour-market effects; and the third section the difficulty of making an overall assessment of NIT or Basic Income on the basis of experimental findings. The fourth section discusses how the public reaction to the release of NIT experimental findings in the 1970s fell victim to spin and oversimplification, and the final section discusses how later reassessments of these experimental findings avoided many of these problems.",

    "abstract": "Emily Ruete's Memoirs of an Arabian Princess was first published, in German, in 1886, on the threshold of the nineteenth-century imperialist 'Scramble for Africa.' Ruete's exilic relationship with both Europe and Africa made her an insider-outsider, well positioned to capture the imperial stage of Enlightenment Orientalism in flux and transmit it across the oceans to a public who would have found the life she describes unimaginable. In relaying the story of how Sayyida Salme became Emily Ruete, the Memoirs employs a mode of translation that is simultaneously linguistic, cultural, religious, and material. In Ruete's case, translation is an embodied act. As a translator, Salme/Ruete critically and comparatively translates Zanzibar, and by extension the 'Orient,' for a Western audience by virtue of her body being able to enter into and to pass through multiple social and cultural spaces. © 2019 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",

We sketch an overview of the wide-ranging initiatives around the world that fall under the banner of ‘interfaith’, and outline the movement’s shifting agenda(s). In doing so, we raise important questions about what it means to consider such disparate efforts to constitute a social movement. A central claim of this introduction, and indeed the volume more generally, is that the interfaith movement is best understood not simply as a ‘religious, but also a socio-political phenomenon. We trace the historical divergence between social movement theory and religion, and underline how the interfaith movement presents an interesting challenge, and indeed a valuable opportunity, to theorists on either side of the disciplinary divide. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, John Fahy and Jan-Jonathan Bock.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the ‘expanded state’ in post-liberalisation India within the context of official responses to the Maoist insurgency in rural central and eastern India. I analyse a scheme called the Prime Minister’s Rural Development Fellowship, which was launched as part of the central government’s attempt to wean ordinary men and women away from Maoist insurgents through rural development. Under this scheme, young women and men are appointed to assist state officials in implementing rural development programmes in districts classified as ‘Left-Wing Extremist’. What does the institution and practice of this fellowship tell us about the state in India today in the context of counterinsurgency and beyond? I address this question on the basis of ethnographic fieldwork in an erstwhile Maoist district in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal. By closely shadowing the everyday work of one Prime Minister’s Rural Development Fellow (PMRDF), I show how the PMRDF is located outside the state, and yet constitutes the state. By focussing on the role of the PMRDF, I reveal one of the many new configurations of the state that are emerging in India today. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "Abu Ma’ali al-Juwayni (d.478/1085) lived in a politically tumultuous period. The rise of powerful dynastic families forced the Abbasid Caliph into a position of titular power, and created instability. He also witnessed intellectual upheavals living amidst great theological and legal diversity. Collectively, these experiences led him to consider questions of religious certainty and social and political continuity. He noted that if political elites are constantly changing, paralleled with shifting intellectual allegiances, what ensures the continuity of religion? He concluded that continuity of society is contingent upon knowledge and practice of the Shari’a. Here, Sohaira Siddiqui explores how scholars grappled with questions of human reason and knowledge, and how their answers to these questions often led them to challenge dominant ideas of what the Shari’a is. By doing this, she highlights the interconnections between al-Juwayni’s discussions on theology, law and politics, and the socio-political intellectual landscapes that forged them. © Sohaira Z. M.

    "abstract": "This is a review paper that tries to analyze family issues in the context of legal decisions that follows Islamic law. During June 2007, the Sharìa Court of Bahrain delivered a decision in a denial of paternity case that offers a glimpse into the complexities of law and legal decisions in countries that follow modern legal codes and procedures yet at the same time continue to render justice from within parameters tied to traditional systems and philosophies of law (Mamlakat al-Bahrain). The case is also worthy of close scrutiny because of questions it raises about the normative image of Islamic law and the sharia's handling of family issues. This image, which dominates Western and feminist scholarship, sees little justice for women in Islamic laws and considers these laws to be essentially patriarchal and consistently favorable to men.",

    "abstract": "Widerquist shows that since the early twentieth century, Basic Income has experienced three distinct waves of support, each one larger than the last. Basic Income experienced a small wave of support between 1910 and 1940, followed by a down period in the 1940s and 1950s. A second and larger wave of support happened in the 1960s and 1970s, followed by another down period in most countries until the early 2000s. Basic Income’s third and largest wave of support took off around 2010, has increased every year since, and shows no signs of dissipating. This chapter attempts to understand today’s Basic Income movement in the context of that history, drawing lessons from when and where the discussion tends to come and go.",

    "abstract": "A significant amount of resources is spent every year on the improvement of transportation infrastructure in developing countries. In this paper, we investigate the effects of one such large project, the Golden Quadrilateral in India. We do so using a model of internal trade with variable markups. In contrast to the previous literature, our model incorporates several channels through which transportation infrastructure affects welfare. In particular, the model accounts for gains stemming from improvements in the allocative efficiency of the economy.We calibrate the model to the Indian manufacturing sector and find real income gains of 2.7%. We also find that allocative efficiency accounts for 7.4% of these gains. The importance of allocative efficiency varies greatly across states, and can account for up to 18% of the overall gains in some states. The remaining welfare gains are accounted for by changes in labor income, productive efficiency, and average markups that affect states' terms of trade.

Broadly defined, a security community exists when sovereign states can overcome a lack of mutual trust and difficult regional environments to develop new forms of cooperative security that prioritize self-restraint and the peaceful resolution of differences and reduce the expectation of the need to resort to organized violence to settle interstate disputes (Adler and Barnett, 1988; Adler and Greve, 2009). © 2019 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",

Against the backdrop of a rich history of moralisation of emotions, I outline how ISKCON’s philosophy has been informed by the context of its cross-cultural transmission to the West and back again to India. In particular, I focus on how devotees manage the seeming impossibility of the central spiritual goal of prema (‘pure love for Krishna’). Through a focus on moral narratives that cohere around understandings of emotion, I suggest that the careful aversion to displays, or indeed claims, of overt emotional experience in Mayapur is best understood by treating emotions as sites of moral self-cultivation. Whereas the anthropology of emotions has tended to privilege temporal episodes of rupture, I argue that more attention needs to be paid to how emotions are conceived and managed in the context of broader sustained projects of self-transformation. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "Afghanistan is being sucked into the growing geopolitical rivalry between the USA and China, just as previously it was sucked into the rivalry between the USA and the USSR during the Cold War and the British and Russian empires in the nineteenth century. In Afghanistan, the different ethnicities have no history of separate statehood. As for the ordinary people of Afghanistan, their deep war weariness and desire for peace has been shown by the Peace March initiative of 2018, calling on the government and Taliban to negotiate peace and denouncing both for continuing the war. As of early 2018, the military situation in Afghanistan appears to have reached a stalemate that cannot be resolved by military means or rather not by military means alone. The reason for this is rooted in a specifically military dynamic, the difference between guerrilla warfare and siege warfare. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Alpaslan Özerdem and Roger Mac Ginty.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines whether economic empowerment of women improves their autonomy within their marital household, and investigates the mechanism, by exploiting variation from a legal reform aimed at improving women's inheritance rights in India. Results suggest that the reform increased women's participation in decision-making but at the expense of the older generation of household members and not at the expense of their husbands. Two channels are proposed to explain this phenomenon. First, this can be driven by a shift in the family structure from traditional joint families to nuclear households. Such a change is consistent both with the increase in women's decision-making authority, which they can exert to move out of the joint household, as well as with men's incentives, since men have weaker financial links with their parents post-reform. Second, even within joint families, the amendments empowered young couples at the expense of the older generation of household members. © 2017 The Author 2017.

    "abstract": "Starting with Henry Corbin’s suggestion that phenomenology can be approached as “the unveiling of the hidden,” the phenomenon is what appears to a consciousness that unveils it as meaningful. Now, in Sufi theosophy, the world is none other than the intentional object of God: “I was a hidden treasure, and I wanted to be known, so I created the world.” This opens onto the question of the Word: the Word is God’s knowledge of Himself, but also the principle of creation. Mystagogically the Word has been referred to as the Name of God. Contemplatives have experienced the Name as a spiritual means of spiritual union, and as such a response to the creative Word. It is within this context that I intend to analyze the bifurcation between silence and invocation. Is contemplative silence bound to fall back onto the limitations of the individual self? Must one think of the invocation of a sacred Name or Word as the methodical guarantee, as it were, of a transcendence of the ordinary egotic consciousness? On the other hand, apophatic spirituality postulates that what lies at the core of contemplative prayer is not the egotic consciousness but the universal and transcendent Selfhood, which Advaita refers to as Ātman. So one of the major questions to elucidate is that of the relationship between contemplative silence as transcendence and the Word or Name as an immanent means of Self-realization. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

Philippe Van Parijs accepted to lead the discussion with the intention of confronting the positions of Jean-Fabien Spitz, Hillel Steiner and Karl Widerquist on private property. The discussion is divided into three main parts. First, the keynote speakers clarify their position on private property and which place this concept occupies in their own theory of justice. These clarifications bring the debate on the commons, and on whether they are compatible with Jean-Fabien Spitz and Hillel Steiner's thesis. Second, the speakers discuss how the dema-terialization of the economy and the development of intellectual property rights raise new challenges to the idea of private property. Are those challenges of such importance that it can lead them to revise their position on private property? Are intellectual private property rights legitimate? Finally, the keynote speakers answer some questions from the audience that lead them to discuss the tragedy of the commons, the notion of prosperity, and the legitimate limitations to property rights. This discussion is especially useful to clarify the positions of each of the speakers on the topic of private property. © 2019 Presses de Sciences Po. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Since the early 2000s, wide-ranging initiatives geared towards the promotion of tolerance, moderation and interfaith dialogue have proliferated throughout the Persian Gulf, culminating most recently in the establishment of the world’s first Ministry of Tolerance in the UAE. For more than a decade, Qatar has hosted annual interfaith conferences on themes such as ‘Steps Towards Tolerance’. Oman and Bahrain have been prominent advocates, pursuing their respective tolerance agendas through academic publications, travelling delegations, exhibitions and international conferences. Even Saudi Arabia, notorious for its intolerance at home, has been a prominent advocate on the world stage. Talk of tolerance, it seems, is everywhere, but what is behind this regional trend? This article situates the emergent political discourse of tolerance in the broader post-9/11 geopolitical context, wherein the ideal of tolerance has been embraced by both the West and the Muslim world as an antidote to the global problem of terrorism. I suggest that Gulf tolerance initiatives are best understood in terms of a broader politics of representation that coheres around the promotion of ‘moderate Islam’, and that in the context of what has been described as the Western ‘civilisational discourse’ of tolerance, Muslim-majority countries are responding with a civilisational discourse of their own. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "This book investigates how ecology and politics meet in the Middle East and how those interactions connect to the global political economy. Through region-wide analyses and case studies from the Arabian Peninsula, the Gulf of Aden, the Levant and North Africa, the volume highlights the intimate connections of environmental activism, energy infrastructure and illicit commodity trading with the political economies of Central Asia, the Horn of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. The book's nine chapters analyze how the exploitation and representation of the environment have shaped the history of the region--and determined its place in global politics. It argues that how the ecological is understood, instrumentalized and intervened upon is the product of political struggle: deconstructing ideas and practices of environmental change means unravelling claims of authority and legitimacy. This is particularly important in a region frequently seen through the prism of environmental determinism, where ruling elites have imposed authoritarian control as the corollary of “environmental crisis.” This unique and urgent collection will question much of what we think we know about this pressing issue.",

    "abstract": "Tensions have long been a feature of the international relations of the Middle East. After the 2011 Arab uprisings, regional instability is being driven by a confluence of three interrelated developments. First, the weakening role of the United States as a power balancer in the Middle East, combined with the larger global context, has provided assumptions about threats and new opportunities for local and other actors to pursue strategic and foreign policy objectives that have deepened tensions and regional competition. Second, there has been a juxtaposing of power multipolarity with ideological multipolarity, itself a source of increased instability, with two of the regional powers, Iran and Saudi Arabia, fanning opposing sectarian flames to further their respective strategic objectives. Third, this strategic competition is being played out in several newly weakened or collapsing states such as Libya, Syria, and Yemen. Similarly, the regional powers’ competition in previously weakened states, such as Lebanon and Iraq, has intensified due to the acquisition of new, sectarian dimensions. These developments are likely to perpetuate instability and tensions in the Middle East for the foreseeable future.[Figure presented] © 2018",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a management perspective of organisational factors that contributes to the reduction of food waste through the application of design science principles to explore causal relationships between food distribution (organisational) and consumption (societal) factors. Qualitative data were collected with an organisational perspective from commercial food consumers along with large-scale food importers, distributors, and retailers. Cause-effect models are built and “what-if” simulations are conducted through the development and application of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) approaches to elucidate dynamic interrelationships. The simulation models developed provide a practical insight into existing and emergent food losses scenarios, suggesting the need for big data sets to allow for generalizable findings to be extrapolated from a more detailed quantitative exercise. This research offers itself as evidence to support policy makers in the development of policies that facilitate interventions to reduce food losses. It also contributes to the literature through sustaining, impacting and potentially improving levels of food security, underpinned by empirically constructed policy models that identify potential behavioural changes. It is the extension of these simulation models set against a backdrop of a proposed big data framework for food security, where this study sets avenues for future research for others to design and construct big data research in food supply chains. This research has therefore sought to provide policymakers with a means to evaluate new and existing policies, whilst also offering a practical basis through which food chains can be made more resilient through the consideration of management practices and policy decisions. © 2017 The Author(s)",

From a sample of Indian migrant workers in Qatar, we elicit the propensity to share with others from their responses in a dictator game and use it as a proxy for altruism. For the entire sample, we find that altruism does not seem to matter. However, we document a strong positive relationship between altruism and remittances for a subset of migrants with a loan obligation, whereas indirect tests of altruism, typically used in the literature, would fail to establish this relationship. We explain the role of loan obligations with a standard remittance model extended with reference-dependent preferences. © Oxford University Press 2017.",

    "abstract": "The family in Qatar plays a significant role in shaping its members' lives, passing down the dominant culture with its history, traditions, values, customs, and social order to subsequent generations. Through the institution of marriage, individuals have been choosing their partners based on criteria passed down to them by their families. They have also been preserving and reproducing the culture, traditions, values, and customs invested in them by their own families by reinvesting them into their own children. By relying on a mixed method approach, the author investigates the role of the family and marriage institutions in the sustenance and stimulation of the reproduction of social stratification in Qatari society. This article is the first of its kind to address the phenomenon of reproduction of social stratification in an Arab state of the Persian Gulf. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2018.",

It explores the fluid nature of the Omani-Swahili identity, the role of the family institution in regulating morality and sexuality, and the impacts of political events and forces on the development of multiple family configurations. It further analyzes key societal concepts such as marriage, legitimacy, succession, post-forced-displacement adaptation, and evolutionary identity. Through a qualitative study, the author uses fieldwork in Oman and Zanzibar, a range of primary archival sources, dialogues with prominent Omani-Zanzibari personalities, and published and private personal memoirs reflecting key historical periods in the development of Omani-Zanzibari identities to speak to the themes of the Omani polity that are unique to the Gulf. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2018.",

    "abstract": "Replete with a cast of giants in Islamic thought and philosophy, Ahmad S. Dallal's pathbreaking intellectual history of the eighteenth-century Muslim world challenges stale views of this period as one of decline, stagnation, and the engendering of a widespread fundamentalism. Far from being moribund, Dallal argues, the eighteenth century--prior to systematic European encounters--was one of the most fertile eras in Islamic thought. Across vast Islamic territories, Dallal charts in rich detail not only how intellectuals rethought and reorganized religious knowledge but also the reception and impact of their ideas. From the banks of the Ganges to the shores of the Atlantic, commoners and elites alike embraced the appeals of Muslim thinkers who, while preserving classical styles of learning, advocated for general participation by Muslims in the definition of Islam. Dallal also uncovers the regional origins of most reform projects, showing how ideologies were forged in particular sociopolitical contexts. Reformists' ventures were in large part successful--up until the beginnings of European colonization of the Muslim world. By the nineteenth century, the encounter with Europe changed Islamic discursive culture in significant ways into one that was largely articulated in reaction to the radical challenges of colonialism. © 2018 The University of North Carolina Press.

I will argue that when a state criminalizes sin (by punishing producers of sinful materials such as illicit drugs, or punishing consumers), it can restrict or eliminate citizens' exercise of metaphysical free will with respect to choosing to partake in or refrain from these activities. Given the value placed on free will in the free will theodicy, theists who endorse this theodicy should thus oppose the criminalization of what I will call Millian sins - that is, actions which are immoral, but which do not directly harm another person. In other words, such theists should oppose legal moralism. © 2018, European Journal for Philosophy of Religion.",

    "abstract": "We study in five diverse countries a laboratory social dilemma game in which incentives to steal from others lead to the socially inefficient diversion of resources from production unless the members of a given mini-society can abide by norms of non-theft or engage in low cost collective protection of their members’ wealth accumulations. We compare two treatments in which subjects have opportunities to exchange free-form messages to one without such opportunities, finding that most subjects allocate far less to theft and most groups achieve much greater efficiency in the presence of communication. Ease of identifying who has engaged in theft varies across the two communication treatments, but is of minor importance to the outcome. We find several coding-amenable elements of message content to be statistically significant predictors of group and individual outcomes. Contributing to the literature on culture, norms, and preferences, we find that the degree to which communication fosters cooperation varies among countries in a manner correlated with variation in survey based trust and with desistance from theft at the outset of our communication-free experiment treatment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

    "abstract": "Oil has seriously impacted the institutional development of the state in the Arabian Peninsula. More specifically, the sudden and unprecedented acquisition of massive oil revenues resulted in the freezing of the state’s formal and informal institutions, at the point at which petrodollars were injected into the state’s coffers. From then on, state leaders were able to deploy the state’s wealth to dictate the pace and direction of institutional change. Over time, any institutional change has been directed towards enhancing regime security, and the pace of change has been calculated and deliberately slow. Any political opening has been dictated by the logic of state power maximization (in relation to society). At the same time, partly to ensure its popular legitimacy and partly through the vision of its leaders, the state has deployed its massive wealth both to foster rapid economic and infrastructural development, and to enhance the living standards of its citizens. In other words, whereas oil may have stunted institutional development –– i.e., an institution’s curse –– it has been an economic blessing. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "Though in many ways the demographics and other characteristics of the Arab states of the Persian Gulf follow the proscribed pathways to modernity, the Arab societies in the region have not completely abandoned their traditional characteristics in the wake of modernization and globalization forces. These societies have found a way to consolidate the external and internal pressures and exist somewhere on a four-way spectrum between 'modern traditionalism' and 'traditional modernism' on one axis, and between 'global traditionalism' and 'traditionalized globalization' on the other. The Arab societies of the Persian Gulf fit neither into the 'cultural maintenance' nor 'modernization' category, but exist and thrive in some space in between, making it an interesting area of study in need of more research. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2018.",

    "title": "The revival of protest in Egypt on the eve of Sadat",
    "abstract": "If the global protests of 1968 represent a high-water mark for mass mobilization of youth around the world, in Egypt the year signaled one of the last gasps of a leftist movement determined to free itself from the grips of Nasserism and the early stages of a revived political Islamism that would come to dominate Egyptian opposition politics in the decade that followed. As some scholars have recently argued when writing of the United States after the long sixties, the 1970s represented more continuity than change from the prior era than previously thought.1 The same case can certainly be made when examining Egypt, whose 1968 protest movement emerged not as a reflection of Gamal Abdel Nasser’s brand of radical nationalism, complete with its pan-Arab, pan-African, and global components, but rather as a scathing critique of its failures. In fact, Egypt’s subsequent shift under Anwar al-Sadat was a direct outcome of developments during the late Nasser era, including the return of a vibrant student movement and the gradual dismantlement of a national and regional project. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Chen Jian, Martin Klimke, Masha Kirasirova, Mary Nolan, Marilyn Young and Joanna Waley-Cohen; individual chapters, the contributors.",

    "volume": "",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade or so, the digital landscape in the Middle East has changed dramatically. Technological adoption, advanced IT infrastructures, communication changes and enhanced connectivity have slowly but surely impacted the region. While much has been written about the role digital media played since the 2011 Arab uprisings, less attention has been paid to the larger digital transformations the MENA region has been experiencing and the implications of these technology-enabled transformations. This chapter focuses on the broader nature of these information and communication changes. It offers critical reflection on how the evolving communication environment and fast changing digital technologies are affecting the region and transforming practices, paying particular attention to the cultural, economic, and political implications of these ongoing changes. The chapter pays particular attention to both the opportunities and challenges the adoption of digital technologies holds for a Middle East that is aspiring to transition toward a knowledge-based economy. It shed light on significant developments and evolving dynamics that characterize the digital Middle East, but also reveals disjunctions and maps out discordances that are inherent to this emerging digital culture.",

    "abstract": "There is no chance of military victory over the Taliban. Nor, without a US commitment to withdraw its troops and accept a major share of power for the Taliban, does there seem any serious chance of a peace settlement (the brief truce to mark a religious festival notwithstanding). Nor, with 100% of the Afghan security budget and around 60% of the civilian budget funded by the US and other outside donors, is there any chance of the Afghan state standing on its own feet. When it comes to the international terrorist threat, it is worth remembering that, after the US, the country that has suffered by far the worst from extremists trained in Afghanistan has been Russia. The Taliban government was the only one to recognize the independence of Chechnya in the 1990s. Russian national interests are also permanently and even existentially threatened by Islamist extremism in a way that those of the US are not.",

    "abstract": "Serving as a means of determining who belongs to the nation, and equally importantly who does not belong, citizenship is an integral part of modern state-citizen relations. Citizenship in the GCC states, however, has long been viewed as largely devoid of political meaning. Instead, it is often seen through a socio-economic lens that sees state-citizen relations as solely based on resource rents exchanged for citizens’ allegiance, despite the limited political rights accrued to them. This chapter will challenge this perception and argue that negotiations of citizenship arrangement in Gulf nations have always been political and a site of contestation for regimes and residents alike. In support of this argument, the chapter will examine the recent surge in citizenship revocations in the aftermath of the 2011 Uprisings, which served to revitalise and strengthen old arenas of contestation over the politics of belonging to the nation.",

We show that the availability of a price-matching option leads to the Cournot outcome in this setting. Our experimental study confirms this result in the laboratory. Our finding is a stark contrast to the one obtained in the standard price competition that the most likely market price in the presence of a price-matching option is the monopolistic price. In addition, we show that price matching benefits consumers in markets with a large number of firms. If a market has a few firms, then the effects of price matching on consumers depend on the market demand and cost functions. Thus, our study suggests that the effect of price matching depends on the strategic variables of the firms. © 2017 INFORMS.",

Gulf States have rapidly expanded their economic and political roles on the other side of the Red Sea and have established military bases. This article argues that this interventionist thrust is historically rooted and deeply structural: the politics of state survival that dominate both the Gulf and the Horn are leading aspiring regional hegemons with a self-proclaimed responsibility to provide order to securitise their near abroad. Originating from the self-identity of regional powers and efforts to protect their respective domestic political settlements, this is producing a profoundly destabilising pattern of regional polarisation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "State-driven investments in art and cultural production in the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are an important part of the search for longer-term alternatives to the longer-term unsustainability of the hydrocarbon-based economic development model. They also are an element in the search for soft power and status, and intersect with the nation-building project. The long-term planned––and unplanned––effects of such cultural initiatives include a necessary opening up to a future of unexpected and often undesired cultural encounters, whether in the classroom, the art gallery, the sports stadium, or the labor office. As states driven by a desire to raise both their regional and international status, but needing to satisfy their domestic conservative constituencies, their greatest test will be their judicious negotiating of the conflicting sociocultural elements of an increasingly globalized world. This volume offers a comprehensive multi-disciplinary analysis of this complex arena and the state of art and cultural production in these Gulf societies, through original studies on identity formation and an emerging museology; the aesthetics of censorship; the question of authenticity; cultural projects as state-driven soft power efforts; the phenomenon of public art; and artistic engagements with migrant labor communities.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Food waste occurs in every stage of the supply chain, but the value-added lost to waste is the highest when consumers waste food. The purpose of this paper is to understand the food waste behaviour of consumers to support policies for minimising food waste. Design/methodology/approach: Using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) as a theoretical lens, the authors design a questionnaire that incorporates contextual factors to explain food waste behaviour. The authors test two models: base (four constructs of TPB) and extended (four constructs of TPB plus six contextual factors). The authors build partial least squares structural equation models to test the hypotheses. Findings: The data confirm significant relationships between food waste and contextual factors such as motives, financial attitudes, planning routines, food surplus, social relationships and Ramadan. Research limitations/implications: The data comes from an agriculturally resource-constrained country: Qatar. Practical implications: Food waste originating from various causes means more food should flow through the supply chains to reach consumers’ homes. Contextual factors identified in this work increase the explanatory power of the base model by 75 per cent. Social implications: Changing eating habits during certain periods of the year and food surplus have a strong impact on food waste behaviour. Originality/value: A country is considered to be food secure if it can provide its citizens with stable access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food. The findings and conclusions inform and impact upon the development of food waste and food security policies. © 2018, Emel Aktas, Hafize Sahin, Zeynep Topaloglu, Akunna Oledinma, Abul Kalam Samsul Huda, Zahir Irani, Amir M.

We compare these arguments to arguments from the height of 'ordinary language' philosophy in the mid 20th century and find that all such arguments face great difficulties. We find a powerful argument for the legitimacy and necessity of knowledgeL (but not of knowledgeH). These appeals to practice leave us with reasons to accept knowledgeL in the face of radical doubts raised by skeptics. We conclude by arguing that by relegating knowledgeH to isolated contexts, the contextualist fails to deal with the skeptical challenge head-on. KnowledgeH and knowledgeL represent competing, incompatible intuitions about knowledge, and we must choose between them. A fallibilist conception of knowledge, formed with proper attention to radical doubts, can address the skeptical challenge without illicit appeal to everyday usage. © 2018 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",

    "abstract": "In her article “The subversion of East and West in Orhan Pamuk’s novel, The White Castle” Adile Aslan seeks to show how Orhan Pamuk plays with the theme of East versus West in his third novel The White Castle (1985), with the aim of de-essentializing both concepts. In 1928, Perso-Arabic script, in use for centuries as the main writing system in the Ottoman Empire, was replaced with Latin alphabet (accompanied by an intensive Turkification of the Ottoman language in the coming years) as a part of a larger modernization-Westernization project in the new nation state, a move which effectively turned every document from before 1928 into an archive. For new generations in Turkey, pre-1928 history is not readily accessible unless one is specifically trained as a historian or a Turkish philologist. While the transition from a multinational, multiethnic, multilingual, and multicontinental empire to a nation-state may never be a smooth process in itself, as it can be reflected in other former empires-current nation states, in the Turkish case it proved to be an epistemic and psychological rupture due to the unfathomable speed of reformations. In an attempt to consolidate one nation-one language-one culture, the westernizing fathers of the new nation-state tried to turn the entire history of their forefathers’ empire into an a forbidden, repressed, inaccessible archive for the generations after 1928. In this sense, the Turkish case represents an internalized colonization. The fact that Turkey became an ally of the US during the cold war and opened itself up to the global market system in the 1980s only deepens this sense of internalized colonization. In most instances, cultural and literary works have been the first to capture the tensions between (post)colonial theory and colonized resistance. The White Castle is a good example that makes visible how intricately intertwined the concepts of East and West are. © 2018, Purdue University Press. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a management perspective of organisational factors that contributes to the reduction of food waste through the application of design science principles to explore causal relationships between food distribution (organisational) and consumption (societal) factors. Qualitative data were collected with an organisational perspective from commercial food consumers along with large-scale food importers, distributors, and retailers. Cause-effect models are built and “what-if” simulations are conducted through the development and application of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) approaches to elucidate dynamic interrelationships. The simulation models developed provide a practical insight into existing and emergent food losses scenarios, suggesting the need for big data sets to allow for generalizable findings to be extrapolated from a more detailed quantitative exercise. This research offers itself as evidence to support policy makers in the development of policies that facilitate interventions to reduce food losses. It also contributes to the literature through sustaining, impacting and potentially improving levels of food security, underpinned by empirically constructed policy models that identify potential behavioural changes. It is the extension of these simulation models set against a backdrop of a proposed big data framework for food security, where this study sets avenues for future research for others to design and construct big data research in food supply chains. This research has therefore sought to provide policymakers with a means to evaluate new and existing policies, whilst also offering a practical basis through which food chains can be made more resilient through the consideration of management practices and policy decisions. © 2017 The Author(s)",

    "abstract": "This chapter assesses whether and how India is developing into a rising power in the Persian Gulf. Dionysis Markakis approaches India’s reconnection with the region in terms of ‘middle power theory’ and disaggregates the dominant economic, sociocultural, and military drivers of Indian policies in the Persian Gulf. Markakis suggests that India is still attempting to carve out its niche in the international system and that multiple factors lie behind its reticence to engage proactively in regional and world affairs. These include the strong element of multilateral alignment that runs through Indian foreign policy as well as domestic institutional weaknesses within the structure of Indian government itself. For Markakis, a primary challenge for Indian policymakers is how to outline a more proactive, rather than reactive, approach to foreign policy and the conception and exercise of power. © Kristian Coates Ulrichsen and the Contributors 2017.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the Middle East’s information and communications landscape has changed dramatically. Increasingly, states, businesses, and citizens are capitalizing on the opportunities offered by new information technologies, the fast pace of digital transformations, and enhanced connectivity. These changes are far from turning Middle Eastern nations into network societies, but their impact is significant. The growing adoption of a wide variety of information technologies and new media platforms in everyday life has given rise to complex dynamics that beg for a better understanding. Digital Middle East sheds a critical light on continuing changes that are closely intertwined with the adoption of information and communication technologies in the MENA region. Drawing on case studies from throughout the Middle East, the contributors explore how these digital transformations are playing out in the social, cultural, political, and economic spheres, exposing the various disjunctions and discordances that have marked the advent of the digital Middle East.",

    "abstract": "The Arab Spring truly caught Turkey by surprise. In interpreting what was happening in the region, Turkey’s foreign policy-makers relied on a particular view, which helped steer Turkey's foreign policy in the ensuing regional earthquake. This article seeks to dissect that view and deconstructs its main components mainly through the speeches of Ahmet Davutoğlu, who served as Turkey's Minister of Foreign Affairs during the heyday of the Arab Spring. The paper also illustrates how Davutoğlu's interpretation heavily borrows from the Islamist interpretive frame of modern Turkish history. That frame, this article claims, originated in the late Ottoman period and has since evolved in contestation with alternative readings, both official and non-official. The article suggests that Davutoğlu's view of the Arab Spring helps explain why Turkey welcomed the Arab Spring and advised Arab regimes to implement political reforms. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "Wilfrid Sellars�s ethical theory was rich and deeply innovative. On Sellars�s view, moral judgments express a special kind of shared intention. Thus, we should see Sellars as an early advocate of an expressivism of plans and intentions, and an early theorist of collective intentionality. He supplemented this theory with a sophisticated logic of intentions, a robust theory of the categorical validity of normative expressions, a subtle way of reconciling the cognitive and motivating aspects of moral judgment, and much more�all within a strict nominalism that preserves Sellars�s commitment to naturalism. The Ethics of Wilfrid Sellars offers the first systematic treatment of this sadly-neglected aspect of Sellars�s work, and demonstrates that his ethical theory�just like his more widely-discussed epistemology�has much to contribute to current debates. © 2019 Jeremy Randel Koons.

From a sample of Indian migrant workers in Qatar, we elicit the propensity to share with others from their responses in a dictator game and use it as a proxy for altruism. For the entire sample, we find that altruism does not seem to matter. However, we document a strong positive relationship between altruism and remittances for a subset of migrants with a loan obligation, whereas indirect tests of altruism, typically used in the literature, would fail to establish this relationship. We explain the role of loan obligations with a standard remittance model extended with reference-dependent preferences. © Oxford University Press 2017.",

    "title": "Riyal Politik: The Political Economy of Gulf Investments in the Horn of Africa.’",
    "abstract": "The Gulf and the Horn of Africa share a long history of economic and political engagement. In recent years, following a decade of political disengagement, the Gulf states have become once again major economic and political actors in the Horn region. Horn states have hardly remained passive clients, however, and actively court Gulf states for funding, as economic drivers and remittances have been a key factor for maintaining their domestic political settlements as well as a major determinant of conflict in the region. This report explores the extent and impact of Gulf state economic engagement in the Horn as well as the linkages between these financial streams and prospects for regional stability in the Horn of Africa. It traces the historic ties framing perceptions of the relationship between the regions, describes the determinants and instruments of Gulf investment, trade and aid to the Horn. It maps the scope of Gulf investments across Horn states and economic sectors, identifying approximately USD 13 billion between 2000 and 2017, mainly in Ethiopia and Sudan, across the agriculture, manufacturing and construction sectors. Such financial streams are key to supporting Horn political settlements, providing the working capital required for further co-option, and to several regimes maintaining a degree of macroeconomic stability (especially under sanction regimes). Gulf states’ largesse is frequently driven by political considerations to limit Iranian influence as well as intra-Arabian competition, but as the funding volumes are relatively inconsequential for Gulf states’ budgets they are frequently devoid of a developed long-term strategy for the Horn. Gulf investments come with risks to Horn stability as well: where Horn states co-invest non-performing loans may jeopardize state f inances. Moreover, some Gulf funding deepens various pre-existing cleavages within societies and is, as such, worrying and destabilizing. However, evidence that Gulf money is causing religious polarization between states in the Horn seems limited. ",

The purpose of this paper is to understand the food waste behaviour of consumers to support policies for minimising food waste. Design/methodology/approach: Using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) as a theoretical lens, the authors design a questionnaire that incorporates contextual factors to explain food waste behaviour. The authors test two models: base (four constructs of TPB) and extended (four constructs of TPB plus six contextual factors). The authors build partial least squares structural equation models to test the hypotheses. Findings: The data confirm significant relationships between food waste and contextual factors such as motives, financial attitudes, planning routines, food surplus, social relationships and Ramadan. Research limitations/implications: The data comes from an agriculturally resource-constrained country: Qatar. Practical implications: Food waste originating from various causes means more food should flow through the supply chains to reach consumers’ homes. Contextual factors identified in this work increase the explanatory power of the base model by 75 per cent.

    "abstract": "Despite growing scholarly focus on the Persian Gulf region in recent years, the institution of the family, one of the central building blocks of the Gulf community, has received limited attention. In the six monarchies of the Gulf, as well as in Yemen and Iraq, the family has historically been recognized as the fundamental unit of society within which social, economic, and cultural development takes place. Studying the family in any context is a complex undertaking, as the family exists not in isolation as a conceptual island unto itself, but rather is deeply embedded in and profoundly affected by changes in its surrounding society and the broader political and economic realities that are continuously evolving around it. In addition, to carefully analyze changes in practices within the family, one must also look to the family-oriented policies that have been implemented by governments to date, and their influences on family identity and behavior. These and other similar issues inform the particular articles that comprise this special issue of Hawwa.",

    "abstract": "Scholarly research on the emergence of a new politics agenda of democratic regeneration, driven by the electoral growth of challenger parties, has focused the analysis primarily at the national and supranational levels, leaving the subnational level underexplored. This article contributes to filling this gap through a comparative analysis of party competition in peripheral regions of Italy, Spain and Great Britain during the European Great Recession. Using Regional Manifestos Project data, it shows that the regionalisation of the state and the presence of a centre-periphery cleavage represent no obstacle when it comes to responding to a change of preferences among the electorate. The transformation of political spaces in the aftermath of the Great Recession is happening as much at the regional as at the national level. At the same time, the political relevance of challenger parties and the diversity of regional responses contradict the alleged secondary nature of regional dynamics. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "This chapter examines some of the challenges faced by GCC nations as they attempt to modernize their economies in the digital era and in the face of substantial technological transformations. In order to fit within repositioned international markets geared towards knowledge economies, GCC states need to abide by the many rules and regulations in the area of intellectual property protection that have been developed and dictated by the World Trade Organization and the agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Interestingly, even as Gulf governments introduce externally imposed legal systems, they attempt to “domesticate” foreign intellectual property laws to gain a competitive advantage by investing in the production of locally-produced content and promoting niche areas of intellectual property, including the protection of traditional knowledge rights. This is an area generally neglected by industrialized nations that tend to promote the concept of “innovation” rather than promoting and protecting collective knowledge. GCC states are attempting to use intellectual property laws to their own advantage with an emphasis on digital archiving and protection of traditional knowledge, heritage, and folklore. By promoting and protecting locally-produced content, GCC states can aspire to the globalized international economic framework as envisioned by the WTO.",

    "abstract": "The long-term unsustainability of a hydrocarbon-based economic future has become a major concern for the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and is one of the main driving forces underpinning the search for alternative modes of economic development. Towards this end, some of the GCC states have been making record, headline-grabbing investments in the fields of finance, healthcare, education, sports, and, as concerns this paper, art and culture. The long-term planned –– and unplanned –– effects of state-sponsored art and culture initiatives are yet to be seen, but are moving these nations onto a more public and international stage. A side effect of the GCC states’ cultural investments is a necessary opening up to a future of unexpected –– and often undesirable –– cultural encounters, whether in the classroom, the art gallery, the sports stadium, or the labor office. As nations driven by a desire to be among the region’s leading powers but needing to satisfy their internal conservative components, their greatest test will be their judicious negotiating of the incompatible elements of an increasingly globalized world.",

    "abstract": "The post-2011 Middle East has witnessed an increasing politicization of religious authority across the Middle East and among almost all faith communities. Unfolding political and social developments, along with steadily shifting posture and functions of the state vis-à-vis the various religious communities has propelled religious leaders into the role of their communities’ political protectors as well as chief liaisons with state leaders and institutions. This has occurred simultaneous with a diffusion of authority within majoritarian religious communities (in both Sunni and Shiʿa majority societies), along with an inverse centralization of religious authority among minority communities such as the Zaydis, the Maronites, and Chaldians.",

    "abstract": "Troubled Waters looks at four dynamics in the Persian Gulf that have contributed to making the region one of the most volatile and tension-filled spots in the world. Mehran Kamrava identifies the four dynamics as: the neglect of human dimensions of security, the inherent instability involved in reliance on the United States and the exclusion of Iraq and Iran, the international and security policies pursued by inside and outside actors, and a suite of overlapping security dilemmas. These four factors combine and interact to generate long-term volatility and ongoing tensions within the Persian Gulf. Through insights from Kamrava's interviews with Gulf elites into policy decisions, the consequences of security dilemmas, the priorities of local players, and the neglect of identity and religion, Troubled Waters examines the root causes of conflicts and crises that are currently unfolding in the region. As Kamrava demonstrates, each state in the region, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Qatar, has embarked on vigorous security-producing efforts as part of foreign policy, flooding the area with more munitions-thereby increasing insecurity and causing more mistrust in a part of the world that needs no more tension. © 2018 by Cornell University.

Insofar as this literature typically focuses on particular religious traditions, however, a critical blind spot has developed whereby the contemporaneous proliferation of transnational interfaith initiatives-that necessarily rely on the collaborative efforts of two or more religious traditions-has often been overlooked. This introduction to the special issue highlights this oversight and explores the role of interfaith actors, organizations and initiatives in the broader narrative of the ‘return’ of religion in international relations. © 2018, © 2018 Institute for Global Engagement.",

Her background and contribution to Muslim nationalism under the British Raj, as well as her various efforts to consolidate the state, including a run for president in 1964, are told through previously untapped archival sources. Examining her life in the context of scholarship on South Asia and on women in Islam, Pirbhai assesses Fatima Jinnah’s role through the theoretical lens of the colonial ‘new woman’. The book delves into the themes of gender and colonialism, the roots of Muslim nationalism and the early challenges facing the Pakistani state, as shown through the extraordinary lived experience of its most influential female activist.",

    "abstract": "This article demonstrates that regional branches of national parties do not limit regional election campaigns to regional issues. On the contrary, they nationalize regional elections (i.e., emphasize national-level issues in regional campaigns) as an electoral strategy to win votes. The empirical evidence comes from the quantitative content analysis of regional-level manifestos of the two main national parties in Spain, PP, and PSOE, between 1998 and 2015. The percentage of references to the national government is taken as an indicator of nationalization. We find that parties nationalize regional elections under two situations: when the national co-partisans are in office enjoying high levels of popularity or when the national co-partisans are in opposition and the nationally governing party is unpopular. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of national parties in subordinating the regional arena to the national one in federal and decentralized states. © The Author 2016.",

Growing populations and expanding economies are driving rising water demands, even as environmental degradation and unsustainable consumption practices increasingly stretch the shared resources of the Indus River. Climate change will compound the challenges confronting water managers. None of the riparian states can successfully surmount these tests on its own. Greater dialogue and coordination among the basin’s diverse communities offers considerable scope for mitigating mutual threats and generating collective benefits. Collaborative approaches promoting data exchange, capacity building, and knowledge generation can help policymakers and the broader public better apprehend and assess the basin’s complex climate and water challenges. Common frameworks for identifying and adopting policy lessons can enlarge the range of policy choices, scale up best practices, and chart cooperative pathways forward.",

    "abstract": "Since the early 1970s, the small town of Mayapur in West Bengal has been home to a multinational Gaudiya Vaishnava community of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) devotees, popularly known as the Hare Krishnas. Although the land of Mayapur is understood to be sacred and therefore conducive to spiritual life, devotees often struggle with the practices and prohibitions that are deemed indispensable for their salvation. They are also, however, both prone to and adept at articulating their inability to live up to the ideals of Krishna consciousness, so much so that narrating failure itself becomes a privileged mode of moral self-cultivation. Devotees inhabit the moral system not simply by conforming to a set of Vaishnava ideals but by articulating their failure to do so consistently within Vaishnava moral narratives that account for the aperture between precept and practice. In other words, they inhabit the moral system by failing well. This article contributes to recent debates in the ethical turn that center on the twin problems of identifying and locating ethics. I suggest that beyond a focus on virtue, the anthropology of ethics must also account for how people relate to vices, and how moral systems accommodate the problem of moral failure. © Giovanni da Col.",

    "abstract": "This volume provides a series of empirically dense analyses of the historical and contemporary dynamics of Arab intra-regional migration to the monarchies of the Persian Gulf, and unravels the ways in which particular social and cultural practices of Arab migrants interact with the host states. Among other things, specific contributions allow us to consider the socioeconomic and political factors that have historically shaped the character of the Arab migratory experience, the sorts of work opportunities that Arab migrants have sought in the region, what their work conditions and lived experiences have been, and whether we are able to discern any patterns of sociocultural integration for Arab non-nationals. Together, the contributions in this volume help unpick assumptions about the Gulf’s exceptionalism insofar as the study of global migration is concerned. Broader dynamics that undergird the causes, processes, and consequences of migration elsewhere in the world are at work in the Gulf region. Vast economic disparities, chronic political instability, linguistic and cultural affinities, and a jealous guarding of finite economic and citizenship benefits inform push and pull factors and integration possibilities in the Gulf region as they do elsewhere in the world. Recent scholarship continues to enrich our understanding of the phenomenon of labor migration to the Gulf. This book takes that understanding one step further, shedding light on one specific, and up until now largely understudied, community of migrants in the region. © Zahra Babar 2017.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the ways in which Arabic literature has been introduced into world literature anthologies. Taking The Longman Anthology of World Literature as a case study, the paper questions the politics of the inclusions and exclusions of Arabic literature in the anthology. Pertinent to the discussion is to ponder the nature of Arabic literature that 'makes it' into the anthology. In addition, the paper will demonstrate how the anthology in fact obscures, rather than illuminates, major historical trajectories of Arabic literature. The complexity of Arabic literature, its highly self-reflexive texts, and its internal developments throughout history beg for a different approach that, I argue, this world literature anthology is lacking. Equally significant, The Longman recycles several common orientalist clichés about Arabic literature, the most important of which is that there is no Arabic literature worthy of inclusion in the three volumes of the anthology spanning the thirteenth-nineteenth centuries. As for the pieces that are included, the paper will reflect on the size and space they are offered, arguing that these are not arbitrary choices, but rather indicative of how a non-Western literary tradition is appropriated into a world literature anthology. © 2017 Copyright 2017 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",

    "abstract": "Applying the Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (2001) decomposition to plant-level manufacturing data from Chile and Korea, we find that the entry and exit of plants account for a larger fraction of aggregate productivity growth during periods of fast GDP growth. To analyze this relationship, we develop a model of firm entry and exit based on Hopenhayn (1992). When we introduce reforms that reduce entry costs or reduce barriers to technology adoption into a calibrated model, we find that the entry and exit terms in the FHK decomposition become more important as GDP grows rapidly, just as they do in the data from Chile and Korea.",

    "abstract": "Over the past fifty years, the primary marker differentiating the developmental conditions amongst Middle Eastern states has been the natural endowment, or lack thereof, of petroleum resources. The difference in economic strength between neighboring states has had a profound impact on the dynamics of intra-regional migration. Migration has largely been from the less wealthy states of the Arab world to the small sheikhdoms of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The particular demographic features and economic needs of the states of the GCC have facilitated this enduring pattern of regional migration. Despite the transition in the Gulf’s expatriate labor force to one that is now sourced mostly from South Asia, the continued employment opportunities provided to Arab migrants in the GCC are still of vital importance, particularly because the Middle East is once again in the throes of high levels of conflict. While the Gulf may not be amenable to hosting refugee populations from neighboring Arab states, the desire of Arab workers to find employment in the GCC can only have increased as a result of instability. © Zahra Babar 2017.

    "abstract": "Once the need to learn a language arises, grammatical instructional manuals evolve from descriptive grammars of that language. Language description involves the uncovering of the rules of the language from collected data, and teaching those rules is the reason grammatical manuals exist. The most comprehensive descriptive grammar of Arabic is Sibawayhi's Kitab (d. ca.161-94 AH/777-810 A.D.). He includes the rules of Arabic as he deduced them from the language of the Arabs. As time passed and the need to learn Arabic increased, many grammarians started to write grammatical manuals for beginners. Sibawayhi's monumental work was too speculative and highly theoretical for this task and was never suitable for instruction. The descriptiveness of Sibawayhi's Kitab needed to morph into a more approachable grammar. Zaggagi's Gumal (d. ca.337-340/948-951) and Ibn Babaša?'s Muqaddima (d.469/1077) are two instructional manuals that are concise and more suitable for beginners. This study examines how pedagogy in Zaggagi's Gumal and Ibn Babaša?'s Muqaddima evolved from the descriptive rules of Sibawayhi's Kitab through a careful analysis of isti?na' 'exception' rules presented by each grammarian in this study. Although the rules are essentially the same in all three books, presentation and description or lack thereof are sufficiently different illustrating their distinct objectives. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.",

On the other hand, there are those who believe that the Maoists exist for the sake of subalterns (Azad 2010; Navlakha 2010; Roy 2011). The two epigrams above encapsulate the contrast between these two positions on Maoism in contemporary India. But there is also a curious common ground between these positions.

    "abstract": "This article explores the legal frameworks of citizenship and naturalization of the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and analyzes how they have been used since the creation of modern states to the present, with special attention to events after the Arab Spring. Within this context, it discusses to what extent the rentier character of the Gulf states has affected the design of policies of citizenship and naturalization; which are the main aspects of the legislation of each country; what are the differences between the use of legal frameworks before and after the Arab Spring; what legal reforms have been carried out since the Arab Spring; and with what objectives has citizenship been granted or revoked. The article concludes that the citizenship policies of the GCC states have been a fundamental aspect of the nation-state building process and the establishment of state-society relations, as well as of a very elaborate strategy to ensure political regime stability, survival and legitimization, especially visible in the aftermath of the Arab Spring.",

A number of specialists and scholars helped identify original research questions concerning the study of Middle Eastern Youth, and shaped the intellectual discussions that went into crafting this special issue. They included Mehran Kamrava, Osama Abi- Mershed, Dawn Chatty, Zahra Babar, Tom Chidiac, Brian Chung, Raj Desai, Kristin Smith Diwan, Soohyun Jeon, Nader Kabbani, Samer Kherfi, Susan Kippels, Adeel Malik, Dionysis Markakis, Suzi Migrani, Ann-Christine Niepelt, Jennifer Olmstead, Anders Olofsgard, Omar Razzaz, Natasha Ridge, Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, Emad Shahin, Soha Shami, and Elizabeth Wanucha. Erika Nguyen expertly read and provided extensive comments on the entire manuscript. The incomparable staff of CIRS and Silatech were instrumental in ensuring the success of two working groups in Doha and Washington D.C. in which the contributors brainstormed ideas concerning Middle Eastern Youth and critiqued each other’s works. Without their hard work, the task of editing the special issue would have been much harder. Other colleagues at Georgetown University were equally instrumental in shaping our ideas and providing helpful advice and insight into the topic. Grateful acknowledgment goes also to the Qatar Foundation for its support of research and other scholarly endeavors.",

    "abstract": "The history of West Asia over the past century has been defined by the collapse of three great empires. Contemporary history of the region is being defined by the decay of a fourth, informal empire -the USA - and the appearance of a new local power, the Islamic State, which is radically hostile to the US hegemony, local regimes and the very existence of the states of the region. These ruins of empire have been preceded, accompanied, and, to a considerable extent, caused by the decay of the civilizational ideologies, which had legitimized imperial rule. While internal culture, social and economic factors have been crucial barriers to modernization, so too has been the dependence of would-be modernizing Middle Eastern states on the US imperial hegemon. This dependency has stripped these states of the nationalist legitimacy which elsewhere has been vital to the introduction of necessary but highly painful and contested reforms. © Mehran Kamrava 2016.",

    "abstract": "While the fact that, despite their strained relations, India and Pakistan managed to negotiate the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) has been widely celebrated as a success, tensions concerning how to share the water resources of the Indus are rising again. The apparent mismatch between analysis and reality is due to the fact that, so far, most scholars have asked the wrong questions when it comes to water security, international law, and the obligation to cooperate. This chapter will introduce a contemporary understanding of water security which goes beyond the narrow state-centered zero-sum game debate and provides a platform for various disciplines to engage in strengthening cooperation over shared waters. This novel lens will then be applied to analyze the legal framework governing the utilization of the Indus. Can the concept of common concern for water security actually be implemented through the IWT? In marrying security studies with international law, potential futures for the legal framework governing the Indus will be illustrated. It is hoped that this chapter will shine a new light on the question whether the IWT is up to the task of providing water security by building a more resilient future for the basin and whether international law has a role to play in bringing about Industan",

It then analyzes ongoing processes of state-building in each of the region’s three states and how the attendant domestic and international challenges of such processes have facilitated opportunities for Iran and Turkey to expand their commercial and strategic ties with each other. The chapter ends with an examination of relations between Turkey and Iran, uneasy neighbors that compete on several fronts but also cooperate out of necessity. It highlights the unfolding of a new game of geostrategic competition and rivalry by these two regional powers over the South Caucasus. Turkey’s favoured tools of competition and rivalry have been its soft power and pipeline politics, and Iran’s are commerce and natural resources. © Mehran Kamrava 2016.",

    "abstract": "Iran and Qatar have little in common in terms of geography, population, history, politics, and ideology. Nevertheless, they have been drawn together in search of common ground by the force of circumstances on one hand and the strategic and policy preferences of their leaders on the other hand. The result, Kamrava suggests, has been the emergence of a broadly friendly “no-dispute” approach by each state toward the other despite what have been at times very trying circumstances and vastly divergent policy preferences. This chapter analyzes these circumstances and preferences, paying particular attention to how their interplay has influenced and shaped each state’s diplomacy toward the other. The mere fact that Tehran and Doha share the world’s largest natural gas structure (called North Field in Qatar and South Pars in Iran) serves as a major area of mutual interest between the two Persian Gulf states. The full utilization of hydrocarbon resources requires a high level of cooperation between Tehran and Doha. © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "abstract": "This article contributes to the literature on trust and small businesses in developing countries by linking the level of trust in others that entrepreneurs display in a lab setting to sales data outside of the lab. The results show a robust positive correlation between trust and business success (with sales used as a measure of success): The successful entrepreneurs invested in trust more than the less successful ones did. In the lab, trusting in others is highly profitable, with successful entrepreneurs doing so to the degree required to maximize revenue. However, I found no association between trustworthiness and business success. (JEL O17, L26, C91). © 2016 Western Economic Association International",

Victory was won not chiefly on the basis of new tactics, but of the recovery of legitimacy for the campaign among the population and the armed forces. This occurred when the war came to be seen as one waged not in the interests of the USA, but for the defence of Pakistan. In Balochistan, the nationalist insurgency has been different from and weaker than that of the Taliban—but may prove longer lasting. Military tactics in Balochistan have closely resembled those of the British Raj, and have been based with some success on fomenting tribal divisions and co-opting tribal elites. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

First, given the multiple commercial and familial linkages between Qatari merchants and individuals occupying the central organs of the state, divisions between the “state” and “business” are more conceptual than actual in Qatar. Second, family and clan dynamics are often highly consequential in shaping patterns of interaction between Qatari merchants and the state, and specifically the Al Thani ruling family. Third, these interactions occur within and between concentric circles of power and influence that begin with a small core of political and economic decision-makers and extend to successive layers of society. In the process, the erosion of the private sector’s autonomy to the centralized, rentier state is further accentuated through its dependence on multiple and overlapping clientelistic networks and linkages connecting the state to the inner reaches of the Qatari society. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

Qatar, which in the last decade has emerged as one of the Middle East’s fastest-growing economies, provides a sound case study for discussing some of the emerging dynamics of regional labor migration. This chapter examines Arab-origin migration to Qatar, reviewing how the state has negotiated the entry and control of “alien” Arabs. The chapter examines the evolution and transformation of migration patterns to the Gulf Cooperation Council, and assesses policies adopted by the states to better manage their regional labor markets and control the flow of foreigners. Particular attention is given to scrutinizing how and why Qatar has become more selective and politicized in negotiating labor migration, and how this has impacted the Arab expatriate population. © Zahra Babar 2017.

This chapter begins with the assertion that Indians might view their country as being in the midst of a whirlpool of river rivalries – meaning, for one thing, that these rivalries are interconnected: the river basins housing the rivalries are common to all neighboring nations, as are their political, economic and strategic roots, effects and implications. In other words, Himalayan Asia’s fresh-water crisis is a shared crisis – as must be the solution. In the matter of bilateral and multilateral treaties governing the sharing of fresh-water, Himalayan Asia stands out for having so few of them. Pakistan’s heavy dependence on trans-boundary water supplies to feed its vast agricultural irrigation system has inevitably riveted its attention on to the Indus system and, in particular, on India’s de facto ownership of the Indus headwaters. © 2015 Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi.",

    "abstract": "By analyzing data from 102 million mortgage loan applications in the US between 2004-2012 (about 90% of all applications) across 3,141 counties and 8,000 financial institutions, we investigate whether applicants' gender matters in the bank's lending decision. We find evidence that female applicants face a higher rejection rate than males, holding all else constant. Similar results are obtained for Hispanic applicants compared to non-Hispanics, and minorities compared to non-minorities. Moreover, we document that this discrimination is pro-cyclical (i.e. peaks in recessions) and that it varies substantially across states. Most importantly, we show that non-economic factors help explain the variation in discrimination across states while economic factors do not. Specifically, we find that gender discrimination in lending is higher in states with (i) high level of conservatism, (ii) low support for gay rights, and (iii) low female representation in the state legislature.",

    "abstract": "In this article it is argued that citizens take into account the degree of a government's political autonomy to implement particular policies when expressing their views on satisfaction with democracy (SWD) but, in order to do so, they need to perceive it. When citizens directly observe the external constraints that reduce their government's autonomy, then variations in levels of regime satisfaction may no longer be exclusively about government performance - as widely argued by political economists - but also about democratic choice. The argument develops after comparing the existing scenarios in the Eurozone before and after the Great Recession. Citizens only began to perceive their own lack of choice to decide between policy alternatives when the sovereign debt crisis broke out in May 2010, the date of the first Greek bail-out. It is then when citizens started to update their beliefs about the functioning of democracy as a system in which alternative policies can be adopted as bail-out deals were signed between national governments from the Euro periphery and the Troika. This updating process towards the way democracy works explains the increasing gap in the levels of SWD between bailed-out economies and the rest of the countries in the Eurozone. Empirical confirmation for this claim is found after analysing Eurobarometer surveys from 2002 to 2014 and using a two-step difference-in-difference analysis that combines individual and aggregate data. © 2016 European Consortium for Political Research",

On the one hand, there are those who believe thatthe movement merely claims to represent subaltern interests but does not, in fact, do so (Guha 2007; Nigam 2009;Simeon 2010). On the other hand, there are those who believe that the Maoists exist for the sake of subalterns (Azad 2010; Navlakha 2010; Roy 2011). The two epigrams above encapsulate the contrast between these two positions on Maoism in contemporary India. But there is also a curious common ground between these positions. Both speak unambiguously from the perspective of subaltern. Which one is correct?",

    "abstract": "The long-term unsustainability of a hydrocarbon-based economic future has become a major concern for the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and is one of the main driving forces underpinning the search for alternative modes of economic development. Towards this end, some of the GCC states have been making record, headline-grabbing investments in the fields of finance, healthcare, education, sports, and, as concerns this paper, art and culture. The long-term planned -- and unplanned -- effects of state-sponsored art and culture initiatives are yet to be seen, but are moving these nations onto a more public and international stage. A side effect of the GCC states’ cultural investments is a necessary opening up to a future of unexpected -- and often undesirable -- cultural encounters, whether in the classroom, the art gallery, the sports stadium, or the labor office. As nations driven by a desire to be among the region’s leading powers but needing to satisfy their internal conservative components, their greatest test will be their judicious negotiating of the incompatible elements of an increasingly globalized world. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "Why have minority women in France made more strides than minority men in terms of gaining access to formal political power Why have they become, in essence, the face of diversity in French politics at the elite national level In this article, I propose that minority women's rise to power has been anything but accidental and is the deliberate consequence of a system cognizant of the need to diversify politics, but institutionally and ideologically underprepared to do so. Because Republican assimilation obviates the formal recognition of minorities in the public sphere, politicians have strategically opted to include minority women in greater numbers than minority men on national electoral party lists and Cabinets in order to satisfy the de facto requirement of minority representation in the 'safest' way possible. More specifically, I propose that politicians across the ideological spectrum often consider minority women ideal candidates specifically for their ability to serve a uniquely dual political purpose. On the one hand, minority women are visible enough to satisfy the basic need for minority descriptive representation. On the other hand, minority women are also deemed more 'assimilable' than men and therefore not too 'visible' to actively threaten Republican ideals or alienate conservative voters. Finally, if minority women are favored precisely because they promise not to dramatically rattle the status quo, this paper suggests that their increasing political presence will struggle to facilitate concomitant progress in the substantive representation of minorities in France. © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 2017.",

    "abstract": "In late 2008 a five-minute video clip entitled Gaon Chodab Nahin (literally, “We Shall Not Leave Our Village”) came into circulation among activists and grassroots NGOs in the forest highlands of eastern India. To those who watched and passed on the video throughout the eastern Indian states of Jharkhand, West Bengal and Orissa, it summed up the plight of adivasi or “tribal” populations in the region as they battled an emerging state–corporate nexus whose plans for rapid industrialization in India relied on greater access to forest and mineral resources. This essay critically interrogates the myriad lives of this video clip through a close study of the real and virtual arenas in which it came to be viewed and engaged by different audiences. Drawing on extensive fieldwork in the forest state of Jharkhand in eastern India, I examine how developmental NGOs, indigeneity activists and rural adivasi villagers came to view and interpret this video differently. These different interpretations, I show, simultaneously perpetuate and destabilize established ideas of “primitivism” in postcolonial India, especially when some adivasi subjects talk back to their well-meaning patrons and critique representations of themselves. Might the production of “primitive” subjects be, I ask, paradoxically conjoined to processes of primitive accumulation in postcolonial India? © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "We examine asymmetric information about migrant earnings and its implications for remittance behavior using a sample of Indian households with husbands working overseas in Qatar. On average, wives underreport their husbands' income and underreporting is more prevalent in households with higher earning migrants. The discrepancy in earning reports is strongly correlated with variation in remittances: greater underreporting by wives is associated with lower remittances. We develop an exchange model of remittances with asymmetric information and costly state verification. The optimal remittance contract prescribes a threshold for remittances that invites verification only if unmet. The model's predictions closely match our empirical findings. © The Author 2015.",

    "abstract": "Marriage between the Economist and the New Left Review may seem like one of Hieronymus Bosch's stranger copulations. Liberal capitalists and Marxists have been drawn passionately together over the past few decades in one area: their common utopian belief in the development of a globalized world without nationalism and national borders, a dream now dying in the West. Elsewhere, it never really took root beyond sections of the Western-influenced (and often Westernsubsidized) intelligentsia. The strongest states in Asia today are those with strong nationalisms, which are central to the legitimacy not only of the present regimes but of the states themselves. The development of strong senses of national identity is not only a regime strategy; it also reflects a much broader awareness in society--bred from historical experience--of the dreadful consequences of national disintegration. One of the reasons why parts of Western society fell so comprehensively for ideas of multiculturalism and the weakening of national identities and borders was an intense complacency about the stability, unity and strength of Western states.",

    "abstract": "The Gulf region has emerged as one of the largest hubs of international migration and more recently has also become a site of contestation for debates over the treatment of international labour migrants. This paper reviews the labour migration system in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, studies the unfolding human rights discourse on Gulf migration, and examines how Islamic principles might be applied to the labour reforms taking place in these countries. The paper suggests that there is a fragmented landscape around the human rights discourse of migrant workers globally. There are also tensions around the adoption of international human rights norms as a framework for addressing the vulnerabilities of Gulf migrants. In conclusion, the paper argues that the category of current Gulf labour migrant is best served if placed within the Islamic view of how an ethical economy ought to function. Islamic precepts on the ‘humane’ economy can serve to provide guidance on how to balance the interests of workers and employers, and elevate the standards for migrant workers’ rights in this region.",

    "abstract": "Utilizing the codification of Islamic Criminal law in the Maldives, this article argues that the process of codifying Islamic law often ignores classical conceptualizations of Islamic criminal law and judicial procedures established as preventative measures against the widespread implementation of Islamic criminal punishments (udūd). Instead of recognizing the legal nuance in classical debates, reliance is placed on a narrow body of texts, and extracted rules are reformed for easy implementation and compliance with modern human rights standards. By ignoring classical discussions of Islamic criminal law, and adopting a singular conception of codification, a paradox emerges wherein the resulting criminal code is less punitive, but more enforceable than its classical counterpart. A second paradox is that on one hand religious legitimacy and moral credibility is desired through the implementation of an Islamic penal code, but on the other, controversial criminalized actions are assumed to be non-prosecutable. © 2017 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",

    "title": "A Myth resurgent: classical foundationalism and the new Sellarsian critique",
    "abstract": "One important strand of Sellars’s attack on classical foundationalism from Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind is his thesis about the priority of is-talk over looks-talk. This thesis has been criticized extensively in recent years, and classical foundationalism has found several contemporary defenders. I revisit Sellars’s thesis and argue that is-talk is epistemically prior to looks-talk in a way that undermines classical foundationalism. The classical foundationalist claims that epistemic foundations are constituted by the agent’s set of looks-judgments. However, I argue that only a subset of these looks-judgments are even candidates to serve as foundations for the agent’s empirical knowledge, and membership in this subset is determined by the agent’s theory of how the world is. Thus, the epistemic force of the looks-judgments in this subset is dependent on the agent’s theory of how the world is. This means that these looks-judgments aren’t foundational at all, as the agent’s theory of how the world is is epistemically is prior to the epistemic status of these looks-judgments. This is the sense in which judgments about how the world is are epistemically prior to judgments about how things look. This conclusion allows concrete elaboration of another of Sellars’s well-know (although not well-understood) claims: “I do wish to insist that the metaphor of ‘foundation’ is misleading in that it keeps us from seeing that if there is a logical dimension in which other empirical propositions rest on observation reports, there is another logical dimension in which the latter rest on the former”. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

    "abstract": "Our main objective in this article is to disentangle the diverse components of peripheral parties' 'issue packages' and to show the different ways in which a peripheral party can present its nationalist credentials according to the strategic needs imposed by each particular context. Against one stream of literature that sees peripheral parties as single-issue or niche parties, we use manifesto data to demonstrate that peripheral parties do not limit their issue appeal to just one dimension of competition. On the contrary, as strategic and vote-maximising parties, they have a highly diversified issue portfolio. We also argue that the centre-periphery dimension has a complex issue structure that allows peripheral parties to offer attractive moderate images without renouncing their nationalist identity. For our analysis, we use the Regional Manifestos Project data on peripheral parties’ manifestos in Spain and the United Kingdom (Convergence and Union, Catalonian Republican Left, Basque Nationalist Party, EH-Bildu, Galician Nationalist Block, Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru) in their respective last regional elections (2011-2012). © 2017, Palgrave Macmillan.

The state of nature, the origin of property, the origin of government, and the primordial nature of inequality and war are popular topics in political philosophy, but are they being used as more than just illustrative examples? Does the best available evidence from archaeology and anthropology support or conflict with the stories being passed on by political philosophers? This book presents a philosophical look at the origin of civilization, examining political theories to show how claims about prehistory are used and presents evidence that much of what we think we know about human origins comes not from scientific investigation but from the imagination of philosophers.",

We review how these models are used to perform policy analysis and document their shortcomings in predicting the industry-level effects of past trade reforms. We argue that, to improve their performance, AGE models need to incorporate product-level data on bilateral trade relations by industry and better model how trade reforms lower bilateral trade costs. We use the least-traded-products methodology of Kehoe et al. (2015) to provide guidance on how improvements can be made. We provide further suggestions on how AGE models can incorporate recent advances in quantitative trade theory to improve their predictive ability and better quantify the gains from trade liberalization. © 2017 by Annual Reviews.",

    "abstract": "Whatever one understands by the term “World Literature,” the allegations of Eurocentrism or an overtly Western-centered approach leveled against it continue to grow. As far as anthologies go, these allegations are difficult to deny. This essay suggests a South-South-South approach as one possible means of redressing this imbalance, and structures of haunting and spectrality as an ideal lens through which to embark upon a re-centered comparativism. The fact that for many Western specialists, a center-periphery approach (where the Western tradition is used to anchor comparative forays into the non-Western) still enjoys a degree of primacy underlines the value of reading across non-Western cultures without necessarily having to travel through London, Paris or New York. Without denying that some consideration of Europe will have to be involved in any treatment of imperialism or parallel modernities—even Chakrabarty’s Provincializing Europe devotes its first four chapters to a discussion of Marx—trying to look at what a certain kind of ghost story means in Mexican, Turkish and Bengali fiction might help to re-configure a different set of parameters from those at present. In this essay, we are going to examine a very specific formula of ghost story, one which appears and re-appears across all three literatures. Each of the six stories we are looking at involve a haunted structure or place, and a male protagonist who either has a relationship with the ghost or becomes a ghost himself. In almost all of these stories, the protagonist is eventually absorbed into his haunted environment. The texts, by writers as diverse as Tagore, Fuentes, Rulfo and Tanpınar, vary enormously in all sorts of ways: some are comic, others bleak and tragic; some of the fictional ghosts try to help, others are malevolent; in some texts a rational observer is visible and assertive, in others they are almost absent. Taken together, the texts span a period of over sixty years (the oldest story was published in 1895, the most recent in 1962). However, the theme of the ruin which connects with, and eventually appropriates and consumes whoever steps inside it, remains a constant. In this article, I argue that there is something about spectrality—and the relationship of both haunter and haunted to a variety of different themes (race, property, history, sex)—that can be discerned in stories with provenances as far apart as Calcutta, Mexico City and Istanbul, and that such an approach can tell us something valuable about what it means to read comparatively without reading Eurocentrically.",

    "abstract": "Following recent debates between Vivek Chibber and leading postcolonial theorists, I probe into what is missing in these exchanges. I focus on the figure of the ‘tribal’ in modern India in Ranajit Guha’s Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency in Colonial India and Alpa Shah’s In the Shadows of the State, both of which claim to offer emic perspectives on subaltern politics and history. Yet both works, despite their undeniable differences, display a striking universalism that puts them, paradoxically, in the company of Chibber. This universalism, which we may call the resisting subject, is about the Other and about us simultaneously, the former constituted by the latter as an abstract object of analysis and as a key symbol of intellectual vanguardism. Are we not better off abandoning such universalisms and searching for ways in which Marxist theories of culture can be melded with postcolonial theories of capitalism?. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",

    "abstract": "Stipulations within the formal protocols of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) established free movement of nationals as an essential component of the region’s movement towards full economic integration. This paper analyzes the protocols within the broader construct that stresses human emancipation and freedom of mobility as fundamental human rights. Throughout the GCC, states face the peculiar dilemma of supporting full freedom of mobility for citizens while also severely limiting and curtailing the mobility of the dominant, non-national population. This paper questions how normative debates on the freedom of movement apply to the Gulf region and examines the policy and practice of strictly managing the movement of international migrants while at the same time freeing up movement for citizenry. This paper proposes that in the GCC, the regional political economy and the processes of regionalization and globalization have combined to tighten controls over mobility and migration.",

    "abstract": "The advent of the principle of popular sovereignty during the French Revolution inspired an unintended but momentous change in international law. Edward James Kolla explains that between 1789 and 1799, the idea that peoples ought to determine their fates in international affairs, just as they were taking power domestically in France, inspired a series of new and interconnected claims to territory. Drawing on case studies from Avignon, Belgium, the Rhineland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Italy, Kolla traces how French revolutionary diplomats and leaders gradually applied principles derived from new domestic political philosophy and law to the international stage. Instead of obtaining land via dynastic inheritance or conquest in war, the will of the people would now determine the title and status of territory. However, the principle of popular sovereignty also opened up new justifications for aggressive conquest, and this history foreshadowed some of the most controversial questions in international relations today. © Edward James Kolla 2017.",

    "abstract": "The Great Game in West Asia examines the strategic competition between Iran and Turkey for power and influence in the South Caucasus. These neighboring Middle East powers have vied for supremacy throughout the region, while contending with ethnic heterogeneity within their own territories and across their borders. Turkey has long conceived of itself as not just a bridge between Asia and Europe but as a central player in regional and global affairs. Iran’s parallel ambitions for strategic centrality have only been masked by its own inarticulate foreign policy agendas and the repeated missteps of its revolutionary leaders. But both have sought to deepen their regional influence and power, and in the South Caucasus each has achieved a modicum of success. As much of the world’s attention has been diverted to conflicts near and far, a new ‘great game’ has been unravelling between Iran and Turkey in the South Caucasus. © Mehran Kamrava 2016.",

What explains variation in relations between religious and secular elites in comparative settings?

We illustrate distinct patterns of religious-secular relations with a paired comparison of two democracies with an intertwined history: The United States and the Philippines. In the United States, religious-secular relations have becoming increasingly conflictual as political incentives have changed in response to religious change. In the Philippines, in contrast, religious and secular actors maintain cooperative ties in part because relative religious stability has diminished political incentives to stoke religious-secular tensions. © 2017 Religion and Politics Section of the American Political Science Association.",

It then presents simple, 'back-of-the-envelope' estimates of the net cost of a UBI set at about the official poverty line: $12,000 per adult and $6,000 per child with a 50% 'marginal tax rate.' These back-of-the-envelope calculations present a greatly simplified UBI scheme meant not as a practical proposal but as a method to obtain a ballpark estimate of the cost of UBI in isolation. Even with simplifying assumptions, these figures are several times more accurate than many common but exaggerated estimates. Key findings of this study include the following. The net cost - the real cost - of this UBI scheme is $539 billion per year: about one-sixth its often-mentioned but not-very-meaningful gross cost of about $3.415 trillion. The net cost of this UBI scheme is less than 25% of the cost of current U.S. entitlement spending, less than 15% of overall federal spending, and about 2.95% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The average net beneficiary is a family of about two people making about $27,000 per year in market income. The family's net benefit from the UBI would be nearly $9,000, raising their income to almost $36,000. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

Islamic social movement organizations ranging from the established al-Gamʿiyya al-Sharʿiyya to the revived Muslim Brotherhood utilized magazines to inform, orient, and mobilize Egyptians while engaging the state directly during Anwar al-Sadat’s ‘Infitah’ (opening). By comparing the framing processes within three of the most prominent Islamist periodicals of this period, this article investigates the process by which movement leaders actively constructed the frames around which activists recruited and mobilized supporters. I argue that Islamist magazines attempted to offer historical continuity with prior movements, authenticity in their teaching of religious thought and practice, and a reframing of a political agenda that was traditionally dominated by state institutions. More significantly, by forging a message that attempted to unify all of these elements, these publications aided in the construction of new communities of believers that charted the course for the next era of Islamic activism in Egypt.",

    "abstract": "The pre-eminent role of nationalized oil and gas resources in the six Gulf monarchies has resulted in a private sector that is highly dependent on the state. This has crucial implications for economic and political reform prospects. All the ruling families – from a variety of starting points – have themselves moved much more extensively into business activities over the past two decades. Meanwhile, the traditional business elites’ socio-political autonomy from the ruling families (and thus the state) has diminished throughout the Gulf region – albeit again from different starting points and to different degrees today. The business elites’ priority interest in securing and preserving benefits from the rentier state has led them to reinforce their role of supporter of the incumbent regimes and ruling families. In essence, to the extent that business elites in the Gulf engage in policy debate, it tends to be to protect their own privileges. This has been particularly evident since the 2011 Arab uprisings. The overwhelming dependence of these business elites on the state for revenues and contracts, and the state’s key role in the economy – through ruling family members’ personal involvement in business as well as the state’s dominant ownership of stocks in listed companies – means that the distinction between business and political elites in the Gulf monarchies has become increasingly blurred. Under current uncertain political and economic conditions, existing patterns of clientelism and the business sector’s dependence on the state will not undergo significant changes. In these circumstances, the business elites are unlikely to become drivers of political reform. In the context of persistently low oil prices, growing tensions related to the definition of the new social contract and the content of structural reforms in the Gulf monarchies are likely to provoke renewed popular frustrations and considerable turmoil.",

This chapter engages with the intricate relationship between media and politics in the context of the changes the region has been witnessing. By mapping out continuities, examining discordances, pointing out uneven developments, and identifying emerging trends, it delves into the complex workings of Arab media. Dwelling on the intricate relationship between media and politics necessarily entails looking at a host of issues that became salient during the uprisings and throughout the transitional period in a post-revolutionary context, but also tying these developments to historical junctures and significant moments that affected the workings of Arab media and shaped the experience of Arab subjects.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the theme of androgyny in the novel Khatam by the Saudi writer Raja Alem. It applies the theories of post-feminists such as Judith Butler and Kate Bornstein and Jungian writers such as June Singer and Erich Neumann. It also draws on theories of gendered space using the works of Foucault. The paper elucidates how the author used the theme of androgyny to unveil the biased patriarchal power in Meccan society at the turn of the twentieth century. Furthermore, it argues that through exploring the complex character of her androgynous heroine, Khatam, Alem intended to reach beyond gender proper in order to reclaim Khatam's humanity. The paper also investigates the question of social classes in early twentieth century Mecca, with particular focus on slavery and ashrâf (nobles). © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2016.",

    "abstract": "To the extent voters respond at all to presidential policy positions, they may do so by changing their views on the policy or by changing their views of the president. Presidents need to account for both changes as they care both about citizen approval and citizen policy views. We explore this dynamic in response to the Iraq War using multiple statistical methods. We find consistent evidence that citizen views of President Bush influenced their support for the war even as citizen views of the war affected their approval of Bush. Net changes in aggregate public opinion were smaller than gross changes because of simultaneous movement in both directions on both the war and the president. Recognizing this two-way movement of opinion helps us to better understand the challenges facing presidents in leading public opinion. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",

    "abstract": "Sudan is usually classified as a “failing” or “weak” state in the international arena due to its incoherent and dysfunctional political system and economic constraints. This chapter attempts to analyze a text on colonial governance and post-colonial forms of surrogacy, written by the late Sudanese secular intellectual Abdel Khaliq Mahgoub, which has been banned by both military and civilian governments. It is argued that Mahgoub’s work operates at the heart of the problems of representation and production of knowledge about fragile states and their relationships to global politics and histories. Therefore, the lessons taken from Mahgoub’s work are important for apprehending the collapse and weakness that characterize the Sudanese state, which cannot be isolated from a nuanced understanding of the emergence of a privileged few who rose as the new epicenter of power and authority.",

Drawing on cutting-edge multidisciplinary scholarship, it explains why caste continues to be neglected in the politics of and scholarship on West Bengal, and how caste relations have permeated the politics of the region until today. The essays presented here dispel the myth that caste does not matter in Bengali society and politics, and make possible meaningful comparisons and contrasts with other regions in South Asia.",

    "abstract": "Although the concept of “state failure” emerged after the Cold War, it gained major prominence after the September 11 attacks with the emerging discourse focusing primarily on the Greater Middle East. This book aims to critically analyse the current definitions and terminology of weak and fragile states, scrutinizing the political implications of the prevailing discourse within the setting of the broader Middle East. It also examines the domestic, regional, and global causes and consequences for the Middle East of the “fragility” of states stretching from Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east to Libya in the west. Employing multidisciplinary perspectives, this book studies the causes and implications of conceptual notions of state fragility across the region in relation to areas such as politics and security, economics and natural resources, intra-and inter-state relations, migration and population movements, and the broader regional and global political economies. It shows that not only are several states in the Middle East chronically “weak”, e.g. Lebanon, Yemen, and the Sudan, most others possess inherent structural and institutional features that compromise their capacity, devoid them of legitimacy, and make them prone to weakness.",

We ask whether the stances on the issue of freedom of speech can be modeled using established sociological theories, including Huntington's culturalist Clash of Civilizations, and those taking into consideration social context, including Density and Interdependence theories. We find support for Huntington's culturalist explanation, in that the established traditions and norms of one's 'civilization' predetermine some of one's opinion. However, at an individual level, we also find social context to play a significant role, with non-Arabs living in Arab countries using #JeSuisAhmed ('I am Ahmed') five times more often when they are embedded in a mixed Arab/non-Arab (mention) network. Among Arabs living in the West, we find a great variety of responses, not altogether associated with the size of their expatriate community, suggesting other variables to be at play. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to question the overarching notion of ‘millenarianism’ as well as its applicability to various ‘tribal’ rebellions and social movements in British India. I do so by carefully re-reading the colonial archives and secondary sources concerning the Birsaite uprising afresh in order to rethink how certain forest-dwelling groups who came to be defined as ‘tribes’ in colonial times actually encountered the modern state as well as Christianity in the late nineteenth century. Why did the Birsaites take up arms? Who rebelled? Against whom? What was the role of religion in their uprising? In answering these questions, I follow the Subalternist’s injunction to take the lifeworlds of the marginal and oppressed seriously in their own terms without imposing, in a vanguardist manner, the pre-existing conceptual order of ‘millenarianism’. Yet I also intend to be faithful to the social historian’s desire to uncover and examine the social location, aims and methods of Birsa and his followers. © 2016, © 2016 SAGE Publications.",

Enacted in 1789, it was little used until the late 1970s, when foreigners notably began seeking compensation under its terms for human rights abuses committed around the world. Recently, the us Supreme Court seemed to put an end to this practice - but the ats is still of interest to historians. After the American War of Independence, Great Britain and the United States maintained a robust trade and close economic relationship. Many Americans saw the perpetuation of these ties as essential to the new republic's prosperity. The ats helped frame the United States' mercantile associations in terms of customary maritime and trade law; in particular, evidence suggests it aimed to provide a mechanism in us courts for the remedy of commercial disputes, especially with Americans' former imperial overlord, in accordance with the contemporary law of nations. © 2016 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",

    "abstract": "This chapter begins with a discussion of the various ways that religion and political parties can intersect. It considers three sets of cases that have provoked considerable scholarship - Christian Democratic parties in Europe, religion and parties in the United States, and Islamic parties in the Middle East. Religion can provide the energy to social movements that seek to change the assumptions, values, and routines of society. Religious cleavages come from religious differences, but nations differ in the type of religious differences that might be politically relevant. Some religious institutions are in a better position to bargain with political parties than others. In particular, scholars have argued that the Catholic Church as a hierarchical institution is better situated to negotiate the realm of democratic politics than more decentralized faiths such as Protestant evangelicalism and Islam. Religious institutions generally create a host of associations that are involved in community and charitable work, that help to organize social life. © 2009, 2016 selection and editorial material, Jeffrey Haynes.",

    "abstract": "Post-revolution states often find that once a transition process begins, challenges can arise, such as political polarization and the threat of civil war. A respected commentator on Middle Eastern politics, Ibrahim Fraihat compares three countries grappling with political transitions in the wake of the Arab Spring: Yemen, Libya, and Tunisia. Fraihat argues that to attain enduring peace and stability, post-revolution states must engage in inclusive national reconciliation processes which include a national dialogue, a truth seeking effort, the reparation of victims’ past injuries, dealing with the former regime, and institutional reform. Women, civil society, and tribes, among other social forces, can support the transition process. Fraihat’s research shows how some aspects of transitions have been politicized and that each country has taken a specific approach, raising or diminishing the chances of civil war or a healthy transition. This book is based on the original field research Fraihat conducted over three years in Yemen, Libya, and Tunisia. It is the result of over 200 interviews with key figures including senior government officials, heads of political parties, revolutionary youth activists, former regime loyalists, representatives of women’s and civil society organizations, military and militia commanders, tribal leaders, and members of displaced communities. © 2016 by Ibrahim Fraihat.

[...]on page 9 of the present volume, Mann repeats his argument from volumes 2 and 3 that BEven in Europe nation-states did rather little until after World War I for before then states had few economic policies beyond tariffs and currencies and almost no social policies,^ and that Ba sense of nationhood did diffuse [sic] butrarely dominated peoples consciousness.^ This is an extremely narrow economists view of the state and is in significant respects wrong. Religion, and its resurgence in various forms in recent decades, is mentioned in passing, but in a somewhat box-ticking fashion as a product of socioeconomic change. [...]Manns account of the Iranian Revolution is excellent when it comes to the reasons for the weakness of the Shahs regime, but has next to nothing on the ideology and motivation of Khomeinis followers, or why they prevailed over the other strands within the revolutionary coalition. Partly as a result of this, despite Manns excoriating criticism of the foreign and security policies of the Bush and Obama administrations, of US militarism, of much of US economic An Exchange Between Anatol Lieven and Michael Mann Over Mann 213 policy over the past generation, and of the anti-rational and anti-Enlightenment tendencies within the Republican Party, Mann is still able to draw a relatively optimistic picture when it comes to the continuation of the USA as the global superpower and Bleading edge^ in the world anda necessary accompaniment of thisthe avoidance of major international conflict. [...]Mann may be correct that the financialization of much of the US economy has not hurt that economy as much as some analysts allege; but he pays inadequate attention to the crisis of the US white middle classes (including what in Europe would be called the working classes) which this economic transformation has produced, or the way in which this is contributing to the growing crisis of the American political system (and which parallels the extremely dangerous rise of right-wing populism in Europe).",

Ports and port cities have evolved at the intersection of local and global forces with port cities having historically played a crucial role as relay stations in globalization by constituting important hubs of trade and traffic. This chapter highlights that the increasing levels of state intervention in urban planning during the recent decades, and the resulting discontinuities and disjunctures in urban form, constitute some of the important and relatively universal hallmarks of the Persian Gulf's port cities. It illustrates that the focus of the book is to explore the internal and external dynamics that have shaped the contemporary port cities of the Persian Gulf, and to examine how these dynamics came about, the ways in which they manifest themselves, and their consequences.",

    "link": "",
    "abstract": "This essay is an attempt at opening parallel but contrastive avenues into the respective Christian and Buddhist outlooks with respect to the metaphysical notion of relativity in contradistinction with the concept of the Absolute. The main thesis is that Christianity and Buddhism present us, in their respective normative intellectual economies, with analogous, yet profoundly different ways of envisioning metaphysics from the vantage point of their sui generis soteriology. In other terms, our argument is that Christian and Buddhist metaphysics are essentially informed by the tenets of their spiritual way, whether redemptive or emancipative. Furthermore, these forms of “soteriological metaphysics” could be encapsulated in the twin nutshells of an “absolutization of the relative” on the one hand, and a “relativization of the absolute” on the other hand. The first formula refers, more specifically, to Christian Trinitarian theology, and the second to the Buddhist ontology of emptiness. These two formulas provide a theoretical framework that suggests both the internal coherence of each tradition and the ways in which this coherence is variously understood within the tradition itself. In the soteriological emphasis of these two traditions lies a possible—but not exclusive—way to open a wider space for a hermeneutics of aspects and vantage points, as well as for warding off any overly rigid conceptual crystallizations through a deeper recognition of the interplay between principled intellectual unity and the manifold of human existence. This essay is the first section of the submission, which is focusing on the Christian tradition. © 2016, ICPR.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the impact of American religious beliefs about Islam in shaping American foreign relations during the First World War by examining the lobbying efforts of Rev. James Barton, the secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, one of the largest American missionary organizations in the United States at that time. During the war, Barton sought to convince both the American public and government officials, including his important network of contacts in the Wilson administration, that converting Muslims to Christianity was a necessity in reforming the empire. In order to do this, he argued that the empire should fall under American or British control after the war. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "The first significant round of negotiations between the Afghan state and the Taliban essentially came to an end on May 21, with the killing by an American drone strike of Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour on the Pakistani border with Afghanistan. The Obama administration, it appeared, had abandoned hopes of successful talks with the Taliban in favor of a military-led strategy of decapitating the movement and provoking its fragmentation as a result. Leading figures in the Afghan government and security forces have urged Washington to adopt this strategy. Afghanistan will likely endure years more of conflict, and the United States will have to retain air power and special-operations forces to prop up the faltering Afghan National Army and to prevent the country from succumbing to its fissiparous tendencies. The collapse of the peace process has led to further deterioration of relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and between Pakistan and the US. The Afghan government, and most US officials, are convinced that Pakistan was never sincere about the peace process, and that its strategy is based on supporting the Taliban.",

    "abstract": "Weak states, with their limited public capacity, economic constraints, institutional inefficiencies, and poor implementation of legislative protections leave marginalized communities at the mercy of a threatening and disrupted social order, and the function of providing adequate social protection is increasingly left to the nongovernmental sector. This chapter examines the two weak states located at the periphery of the greater Middle East, Pakistan and Sudan, focusing in particular on how conditions within each have driven NGOs to play a dominant role in addressing the exclusion of women who form one of society's marginalized groups. It reviews and evaluates the attempts of two organizations—Sarhard Rural Support Programme in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and Plan International in North Kordofan in Sudan—that are delivering financial services to women living in areas located at the margins of each country where the reach of the state is particularly tenuous.",

    "abstract": "In what order should a developing country adopt policy reforms? Do some policies complement each other? Do others substitute for each other? To address these questions, we develop a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model with entry and exit of firms that are monopolistic competitors. Distortions in the model include barriers to entry of firms, barriers to international trade, and barriers to contract enforcement. We find that a reform that reduces one of these distortions has different effects depending on the other distortions present. In particular, reforms to trade barriers and barriers to the entry of new firms are substitutes, as are reforms to contract enforcement and trade barriers. In contrast, reforms to contract enforcement and the barriers to entry are complements. Finally, the optimal sequencing of reforms requires reforming trade barriers before contract enforcement. © 2016",

    "abstract": "Bullets and Bulletins takes a sobering and holistic look at the intersections between media and politics before, during, and in the wake of the Arab uprisings. It is a multi-disciplinary approach to the topic, with the research backed up by in-depth and rigorous case studies of the key countries of the Arab uprisings. The protests were accompanied by profound changes in the roles of traditional and new media across the Middle East. What added significantly to the amplification of demands and grievances in the public spheres, streets and squares, was the dovetailing of an increasingly indignant population—ignited by the prospects of economic and political marginalisation—with high rates of media literacy, digital connectivity, and social media prowess. This combination of political activism and mediated communication turned popular street protests into battles over information, where authorities and activists wrestled with each other over media messages. Information and communication technologies were used by both government authorities and protestors as simultaneous tools for silencing or amplifying dissent. Bullets and Bulletins offers original insights and analysis into the role of traditional and new media in what is undoubtedly a most critical period in contemporary Middle Eastern history.",

The chapters in part one, ‘Arab Media in Transition’ explore the broad changes that have occurred in the relationship between the growing Arab mediascape and the turbulent political environment of the Middle East and North Africa region. Part two, ‘Space and the Cultural Production of Arab Media’, provides an analysis of the relationship between space—both physical and virtual—and the public’s growing involvement in cultural creation. The chapters in this section focus on everyday practices, narratives, and identity formations that are negotiated in the informal public sphere of the street and cyberspace, as well as how these issues play out in formally organized media cities. The final part of this book, ‘Media, State Interests, and Non-State Actors’, explores the radical shift in state-society power relations in a number of Arab countries. The chapters in this concluding section elaborate on how Arab publics have taken media tools into their own hands, ensuring that the future of information is no longer the sole monopoly of the state.",

    "abstract": "Bullets and Bulletins takes a sobering and holistic look at the intersections between media and politics before, during, and in the wake of the Arab uprisings. It is a multi-disciplinary approach to the topic, with the research backed up by in-depth and rigorous case studies of the key countries of the Arab uprisings. The protests were accompanied by profound changes in the roles of traditional and new media across the Middle East. What added significantly to the amplification of demands and grievances in the public spheres, streets and squares, was the dovetailing of an increasingly indignant population—ignited by the prospects of economic and political marginalisation—with high rates of media literacy, digital connectivity, and social media prowess. This combination of political activism and mediated communication turned popular street protests into battles over information, where authorities and activists wrestled with each other over media messages. Information and communication technologies were used by both government authorities and protestors as simultaneous tools for silencing or amplifying dissent. Bullets and Bulletins offers original insights and analysis into the role of traditional and new media in what is undoubtedly a most critical period in contemporary Middle Eastern history.",

    "abstract": "The outrage over genocidal violence in Sudan provided impetus to “legalise” the concept of humanitarian intervention into a “responsibility to protect” (R2P). However, a decade on, the literature treats Darfur and R2P as coterminous with failure: continued inaction underscored its limitations in delivering protection to civilians. This article argues that this is an impoverished reading, which leaves out important dynamics. The legacy of Darfur is more usefully understood as a formative experience for further intervention, rather than as a benchmark of (non-)compliance with the specificities of an evolving R2P norm. We analyse an intensifying functional convergence between Western actors, the Chinese Communist Party and the African Union around the practice of intervention, with a view to creating political order and not to foster regime change, on the continent. Darfur, in this reading, was an indicator of the increasing tendency towards approaching Africa through an interventionist lens of stabilisation, more so than the premature abortion of a nascent norm. © 2015 The Author(s).",

The book argues that throughout the 2000s Turkey and Qatar had pursued similar foreign policies and aligned their positions on many critical and controversial issues. By doing so, however, they increasingly isolated themselves in the Middle East as states challenging the status quo. The claim made here is that it is this isolation-which became acute in the summer of 2013-that led the two countries to forge much stronger relations. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.",

    "abstract": "Traditional accounts of Nile Basin politics tend to focus on the trajectories of the region’s key states - Egypt, Ethiopia, Sudan - and the international legal context of disputes over water. For many, the central dynamic has been the classic conflict-cooperation dichotomy (Wiebe, 2001; Swain, 2002; Mekonnen, 2010), which has led to attempts to explain what conditions need to be met to transition from adversarial relations to more collaborative ones (Howell and Allan, 1994; Waterbury, 1997; Wu and Whittington, 2006; Salman, 2013). Those working in this vein have mostly concentrated, following the title of Waterbury’s classic contribution, on the national determinants of regional hydropolitics (Waterbury, 2002; Salman, 2011), with a supportive role for Western-dominated international financial institutions such as the World Bank, whose capital has often been a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for transforming basin politics around the world. As the West has faced relative decline in the past ten years, scholarship has increasingly dissected the impact of emerging financiers of water resources development projects such as China (Cascão, 2009; Verhoeven, 2011a, 2011b). Concentrating on the Nile Basin states, Western powers (Britain as colonial hegemon and later the USA as global superpower) and more recently China has obscured the important longitudinal role played by Gulf states in regional relations generally and hydropolitics in particular. The mass provision of oil and gas to international markets is but one dimension of the Gulf’s rise to global prominence (Ulrichsen, 2011). The leading polities - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar - have long seen Africa’s north-eastern corner as a logical extension of their socio-cultural, economic and political sphere and have, through exchanges characterized by both animosity and partnership, influenced the fortunes of states and regimes there. This historical proximity has in the last decades very much been an asymmetric relationship with people and produce moving to the Arabian Peninsula from the basin, and capital and ideological currents flowing the other way across the Red Sea: an inversion of older trends. In a context of enduring statehood but simultaneous state fragility in the Nile Basin, this asymmetry has had profound consequences in that both domestic political economies and intra-basin relations have been shaped by Gulf Arab interests in important ways. The Nile has for decades been not just the main ecological highway of Northeast Africa but also its most important political artery, with elites trying to harness its economic potential for state-building (Verhoeven, 2015a, 2015b, 2015c). The idea that control over water equals control over people and that, hence, water is power has proven deeply consequential: the question of how the river’s waters can be put at the service of internal power consolidation and economic expansion has throughout the modern period been a key determinant of the behaviour of ruling elites in their external policy. This has given rise to a zero-sum paradigm in the basin in which the relative gains of one party are seen to imply a material degradation and political humiliation for the others. In this unforgiving strategic environment, the fortunes of incumbents are heavily influenced by their ability to leverage outside resources for internal battles. While Ethiopian relations with the Gulf states have been antagonistic for most of the past 60 years almost regardless of the ideological disposition of governments in Addis Ababa, regimes in Egypt and Sudan have intermittently been isolated from the Arabian Peninsula, only to reverse the situation a few years later and to draw on Gulf Arab financial resources and politico-military backing to secure domestic hegemony and expand their regional influence. In recent decades, big hydro-agricultural initiatives in Sudan and Egypt have not just depended on Gulf funding but the very ability of secular, military and Islamist regimes to remain hegemonic in their societies and the region has been moulded by relations with Riyadh and, more recently, Abu Dhabi and Doha. This chapter is theoretically informed by the historical and international sociology approach to understanding states, their constituent social forces and their interrelations (Halliday, 2005). It opens with a brief sketch of the longue durée of relations between the Arabian Peninsula and the Nile Basin: after situating centuries of historical proximity, the focus moves to Egyptian ‘hydro-hegemony’, a term used to explore the subtle and not so subtle mechanisms underpinning a state’s dominance in basin politics (Zeitoun and Warner, 2006). Gamal Abdel Nasser’s bid for a revitalized Egypt via the construction of the Aswan High Dam and the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement (NWA) was initially supported by the Gulf Arabs. However, Cairo and Riyadh soon battled for leadership of the Arab world - a collision that ushered in a growing asymmetry between a stagnating Egypt and Gulf states bolstered by soaring oil prices. Following rapprochement between Sadat and the Al-Sauds, a different relationship emerged in the 1970s during which the Gulf became the Egyptian economy’s financier, funded hydro-agricultural state-building in Ja’afar Nimeiri’s Sudan and encouraged the containment of Marxist-Leninist and ‘Christian’ Ethiopia. Cairo’s hydro-hegemony was increasingly underwritten by petrodollars, which also paid for Sudan’s ‘Breadbasket’ vision to address exacerbating food security problems on the Arabian Peninsula. The latter parts of this chapter outline the limits of the rising prominence of Gulf Arabs and their ability to pursue political-economic objectives and reshape the Nile Basin from the 1980s until today. Not only have the Gulf states increasingly vied for regional influence at each other’s expense, they have regularly been frustrated in the pursuit of their interests, politically as well as economically. The failure of the Breadbasket gamble and the Agricultural Revival Programme in Sudan, as well as the rise to power of the militaryIslamist Al-Ingaz regime in Khartoum, have generated security, commercial and political woes for Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE. It also contributed to the erosion of the hegemony of Egypt - Riyadh’s most loyal ally - in the basin, to the advantage of Ethiopia, an old rival long distrusted on the Arabian Peninsula. This is the other side of the coin of influence: growing exposure and involvement also imply growing disappointments. © 2016 Nordic Africa Institute.",

    "abstract": "Glittering skylines, high urbanization rates, and massive development projects have been common characteristics of the cities in the Persian Gulf. In order to understand the city as a cultural and social space, this book explores the changing urban face of the Persian Gulf cities, as well as the processes and consequences of transformations that have occurred at an incredibly rapid pace. While some of these cities have rapidly evolved from regional centers of cultural and economic exchange to globalizing cities deeply embedded within the global economy, others have either left their best days behind them or largely retained their traditional fabrics. Yet forces of globalization and migration, national conceptualizations of citizenship, and various political and economic structures have collectively underpinned the politics of urban planning and development in the port cities of the Persian Gulf. The focus of this book revolves around the internal and external dynamics and developments that have shaped these contemporary port cities, and their roles, changing face, and broader consequences for the region and beyond. The Persian Gulf has long been a gateway to the world. This book provides a comprehensive study of the nature and importance, rise and fall, and domestic and international consequences of its port cities in modern times.",

    "abstract": "Background: In recent years, supported by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), a number of community-based health insurance (CBHI) schemes have been operating in rural India. Such schemes design their benefit packages according to local priorities. This paper examines healthcare seeking behaviour among self-help group households with a view to understanding the implications for the benefit packages offered by such schemes. Methods: We use cross-sectional data collected from two of India's poorest states and estimate an alternative-specific conditional logit model to examine healthcare seeking behaviour. Results: We find that the majority of respondents do access some form of care and that there is overwhelming use of private providers. Non-degree allopathic providers (NDAP) also called rural medical practitioners are the most popular providers. In the case of acute illnesses, proximity plays an important role in determining provider choice. For chronic illnesses, cost of care influences provider choice. Conclusion: Given the importance of proximity in determining provider choice, benefit packages offered by CBHI schemes should consider coverage of transportation costs and reimbursement of foregone earnings. © 2016 Raza et al.",

    "abstract": "Certain Arab cities of the Persian Gulf have emerged as models to which the other cities of Middle East are aspiring. This chapter identifies three ideal types of port cities across the Persian Gulf, namely company towns, secondary cities, and aspiring global cities. It is argued that the aspiring global cities predominate the life of the entire country and overshadow all other urban formations by being the main recipients of public and private attention and resources. As a consequence, the potential significance of secondary cities and company towns both at home and abroad is impeded due to policy neglect and inadequate resources. In the course of the discussion, this chapter also illustrates that active engagement with and participation in globalization may have propelled these cities into a higher plain of infrastructural development and modern urbanism; but it has also brought massive migration of laborers in search of employment and unsettling levels of demographic imbalance.",

    "documentType": "Research Paper",
    "abstract": "The pre-eminent role of nationalized oil and gas resources in the six Gulf monarchies has resulted in a private sector that is highly dependent on the state. This has crucial implications for economic and political reform prospects. All the ruling families – from a variety of starting points – have themselves moved much more extensively into business activities over the past two decades. Meanwhile, the traditional business elites’ socio-political autonomy from the ruling families (and thus the state) has diminished throughout the Gulf region – albeit again from different starting points and to different degrees today. The business elites’ priority interest in securing and preserving benefits from the rentier state has led them to reinforce their role of supporter of the incumbent regimes and ruling families. In essence, to the extent that business elites in the Gulf engage in policy debate, it tends to be to protect their own privileges. This has been particularly evident since the 2011 Arab uprisings. The overwhelming dependence of these business elites on the state for revenues and contracts, and the state’s key role in the economy – through ruling family members’ personal involvement in business as well as the state’s dominant ownership of stocks in listed companies – means that the distinction between business and political elites in the Gulf monarchies has become increasingly blurred. Under current uncertain political and economic conditions, existing patterns of clientelism and the business sector’s dependence on the state will not undergo significant changes. In these circumstances, the business elites are unlikely to become drivers of political reform. In the context of persistently low oil prices, growing tensions related to the definition of the new social contract and the content of structural reforms in the Gulf monarchies are likely to provoke renewed popular frustrations and considerable turmoil.",

The reality of secularity has not eviscerated the affinity between religion and America's legacy of freedom, justice, and liberty. James Forbes is a man whose odyssey, ministry, and vocation embody an idea that I have been wrestling with for a long time. This paper therefore focuses on an important voice in contemporary American Christianity: that of James A. Forbes, the Senior Minister Emeritus of The Riverside Church in New York City. For eighteen years, he captivated, rejuvenated, and inspired America with his profound prophetic insights on peace and the common good. The pulpit is the ideal home for James Forbes. His messages and vision go beyond mere theological emotionalism or sophistry; they are deeply rooted in the religious, social, cultural, political, and economic realities of America in particular and the world as a whole.",

The study of weak states is itself a controversial terrain where the very definitions of “weak” and “collapsed” or “failed” states are contested. This chapter outlines some of the more salient controversies involving the weak and failed states discourse, and addresses the question of where weak states come from, examining the causes and characteristics of state weakness and failure. It also discusses the role of the more powerful states and international organizations that have invested considerable sums of money in fragile states because they view them as threats to international security.",

    "abstract": "Once just sleepy desert sheikdoms, the Arab Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait now exert unprecedented influence on international affairs-the result of their almost unimaginable riches in oil and gas. In this book, Rory Miller, an expert in Gulf politics and international affairs, provides an accessible account of the achievements of these countries since the 1973 global oil crisis. He also investigates how the shrewd Arab Gulf rulers who have overcome crisis after crisis meet the external and internal challenges of the onrushing future. The Arab Gulf region has become an East-West hub for travel, tourism, sport, culture, trade, and finance. But can the autocratic regimes maintain stability at home and influence abroad as they deal with the demands of social and democratic reform? Miller considers an array of factors-Islamism, terrorism, the Arab Spring, volatile oil prices, global power dynamics, and others-to assess the future possibilities. © 2016 Rory Miller.",

    "abstract": "In this chapter I look at the question “How important is it for you to live in a country that is governed democratically?” as it appears in Round 6 of the European Social Survey. The first objective of this chapter is to analyze whether this indicator really measures commitment to the principles of liberal representative democracy. In this respect, the analysis shows, first, that the importance of living in a democracy is not a valid indicator of strong commitment to liberal representative democracy and, second, that this indicator works better if dichotomized at its highest value (value “10”). The second objective is to analyze how the relationship between the importance of living in a democracy and the principles of liberal representative democracy is modified by individual- and macro-level factors, both in the short and the long term.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates how and why dam building has fulfilled a crucial role in hegemonic projects of elite consolidation and nation-building. By drawing on the case of Sudan's Dam Programme and the associated propaganda the Khartoum government has produced, we show how the dams have not just served to materially restructure the Sudanese political economy but have also been essential in the attempted rekindling of the identity of both the regime and the country. Massive investment in hydro-infrastructure dovetailed with the political rebalancing of an authoritarian system in crisis, turning dam-builders into nation-builders: the message of the dams as midwife to a pious, prosperous and revitalised Sudan allowed it to reconcile the nationalism of its military and security wing with the enduring ambitions for transformation of its Islamist base. Dam building in Sudan, as elsewhere, has thus meant a physical redrawing of the landscape and intensified rent creation and seeking but also embodies a high modernist narrative that matches the interests and worldviews of very different constituencies. This, we argue, helps explain its salience in earlier periods of state-building and nation-building, as well as contemporarily.",

    "abstract": "Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have a long history of student engagement and institutional commitment to developing STEMM degrees. To become even better at fostering a diverse STEMM field, HBCUs must assess their strengths, weaknesses and challenges as well as opportunities in order to remain competitive in the 21st century. This chapter explores factors related to improving STEMM student academic preparation, retention and engagement. The authors provide recommendations to enhance experiential learning and offer educational pathways that lead to long-term retention and engagement of minority students. Furthermore, in the face of the need to advance and diversify the scientific workforce, we examine whether and how specific institutional contexts shape student interactions with faculty and institutional cultures. Historically black colleges and universities have played an important role in diversifying the Science Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) workforce. In this paper we offer practical suggestions to clarify and strengthen their roles in student recruitment, retention, engagement, and advancement in STEMM. Preparatory summer. © 2016 by IGI Global.

    "abstract": "This paper assesses five major transboundary-related problems currently troubling the Bengal region and bedeviling, in particular, the relationship between Bangladesh and India. These problems relate to settlement of the land boundary (enclaves and adverse possessions), facilitation of transboundary transit (road, rail, and waterway), curbing of transboundary illicit activity (smuggling, human trafficking, and covert support for radical Islamist groups and separatist militants), sharing of transboundary river resources, and control of transboundary migration. The paper’s focus is on the potential and capacity of the political entities sharing the Bengal region to identify, agree upon, and implement effective and sustainable solutions to these problems. It argues that such solutions, to be sustainable, would have to prioritize cross-border cooperation and mutual benefit—objectives that have thus far neither been aggressively nor consistently pursued in this region. The authors observe that the transboundary problems troubling the Bengal region vary substantially in the extent of their intractability and that some of them will persist far into the future. Nevertheless, they conclude that the present scale as well as the severity of the consequences of these problems are not permanent fixtures and will vary enormously with the political will, perseverance, and skill of those charged with determining the political destiny of this hugely important region.",

    "abstract": "I analyze the status of the temporal NPI ʕʊmr and NCI baʕd in Jordanian Arabic and explain their distribution and syntactic licensing. Despite their head-like properties (hosting clitics and assigning case), I argue that both elements are AdvPs in Spec-XP positions rather than heads projecting their own clausal structure. These items can be pre-verbal or post-verbal; they differ in their ability to precede negative constituents; they require a complement (DP or CP) that can be co-referential with the subject or object of the clause (or, in the NPI case, the pronominal complement inside a syntactic island). I contend that the similarities and differences among these properties follow from the fact that ʕʊmr may be base-generated either pre-verbally or post-verbally, while baʕd is always base-generated post-verbally and optionally moves to a pre-verbal position. I conclude that both c-command and specifier-head configurations can license such items, while the head-complement configuration cannot.",

    "abstract": "This essay is an attempt at opening parallel but contrastive avenues into the respective Christian and Buddhist outlooks with respect to the metaphysical notion of relativity in contradistinction with the concept of the Absolute. The main thesis is that Christianity and Buddhism present us, in their respective normative intellectual economies, with analogous, yet profoundly different ways of envisioning metaphysics from the vantage point of their sui generis soteriology. In other terms, our argument is that Christian and Buddhist metaphysics are essentially informed by the tenets of their spiritual way, whether redemptive or emancipative. Furthermore, these forms of “soteriological metaphysics” could be encapsulated in the twin nutshells of an “absolutization of the relative” on the one hand, and a “relativization of the absolute” on the other hand. The first formula refers, more specifically, to Christian Trinitarian theology, and the second to the Buddhist ontology of emptiness. These two formulas provide a theoretical framework that suggests both the internal coherence of each tradition and the ways in which this coherence is variously understood within the tradition itself. In the soteriological emphasis of these two traditions lies a possible—but not exclusive—way to open a wider space for a hermeneutics of aspects and vantage points, as well as for warding off any overly rigid conceptual crystallizations through a deeper recognition of the interplay between principled intellectual unity and the manifold of human existence. This essay is the second section of the article, and focuses on the Buddhist tradition. © 2016, ICPR.",

Her biography illustrates the discursive pressures shaping the lives of upper and intermediate class men and women of her generation, particularly as manifested in the unquestioned tropes of modernization theory. However, the same life reveals that her notion of the tradition-modernity dichotomy does not extend to the equation of Islam with tradition. The secular-religious divide, in fact, does not feature in her thought or activism at all. The latter activism also problematizes the assumption that Muslim women, any more of less than non-Muslims, are marginal or peripheral players in the history of the twentieth century. © 2016 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",

    "abstract": "Drawing on a rich pragmatist tradition, this book offers an account of the different kinds of 'oughts', or varieties of normativity, that we are subject to contends that there is no conflict between normativity and the world as science describes it. The authors argue that normative claims aim to evaluate, to urge us to do or not do something, and to tell us how a state of affairs ought to be. These claims articulate forms of action-guidance that are different in kind from descriptive claims, with a wholly distinct practical and expressive character. This account suggests that there are no normative facts, and so nothing that needs any troublesome shoehorning into a scientific account of the world. This work explains that nevertheless, normative claims are constrained by the world, and answerable to reason and argumentation, in a way that makes them truth-apt and objective. © Th e Editor(s) (if applicable) and Th e Author(s) 2016.",

    "abstract": "This essay is a meditation on the human vocation to transcendence and its metaphysical roots in nonduality through the works of perennialist philosopher Frithjof Schuon (1907-1998). What spiritual traditions the world over arguably share in terms of their understanding of mankind lies in their recognition of a need for transcending the purely natural sphere of interest of the human ego. This essay examines the ways in which Schuon's exposition of this vocation to transcendence relies on the principles of the objectivity and totality of human intelligence and the human will. Schuon's metareligious point of view, together with his intellectual and spiritual position at the confluence of several traditions, such as Hindu, Sufi gnosis and Rhineland Christian mysticism, offers an unusually rich and fruitful way of elucidating the insights of the central streams of both European and Asian traditions. It also provides keys for enlightening the meaning of the duality within the human self and two postulations of mankind toward transcendence and immanence. Schuon's meditations allow one to consider the ways in which metaphysical nondualism, such as Advaita Vedanta, does not contradict the religious impulse of devotion but in fact coincides with its deepest ground.",

We conduct a laboratory experiment to study how culture interacts with institutions in shaping individuals’ behaviors and group outcomes in a property rights dilemma. The experiment is conducted in five countries: Austria, Mexico, Mongolia, South Korea and the United States. We find that the security of property varies with the experimentally available institutions and country-level indicators such as trust and quality of government. Subjects from countries with higher levels of trust are more likely to abstain initially from theft, devote more resources to production and support funding public protection of property through taxation. Our findings highlight the relevance of cultural and institutional factors, and their interaction, in addressing the collective action problem of safeguarding property rights. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",

However, international relations scholar Mehran Kamrava argues that Israel's “state-building” process has never risen above the level of municipal governance, and its goal has never been Palestinian independence. He explains that a coherent Palestinian state has already been rendered an impossibility, and to move forward, Palestine must redefine its present predicament and future aspirations. Based on detailed fieldwork, exhaustive scholarship, and an in-depth examination of historical sources, this controversial work will be widely read and debated by all sides. © 2016 by Mehran Kamrava.

By some estimations, the six GCC states comprise the third largest migratory destination in the contemporary world, and for decades these states have hosted large transient migrant populations that, in some manner or another, appear to fit the definition of circular migration. Through an analysis of migration to the Gulf States this chapter provides an empirical contribution to the expanding discussion of circular migration. In this chapter the nexus between the Gulf migration system and the circular migration framework is configured around two focal points. After an overview of migration in the Gulf States, the authors first examine the policy frameworks that regulate and govern migration to the GCC. Second, using an ethnographic lens, the authors explore the experiences of the migrants at work in the region. They conclude with a discussion of the implications of promoting the circular migration framework in the region.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as Americans increasingly came into contact with the Islamic world, U.S. diplomatic, cultural, political, and religious beliefs about Islam began to shape their responses to world events. In Sacred Interests, Karine V. Walther excavates the deep history of American Islamophobia, showing how negative perceptions of Islam and Muslims shaped U.S. foreign relations from the Early Republic to the end of World War I. Beginning with the Greek War of Independence in 1821, Walther illuminates reactions to and involvement in the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, the efforts to protect Jews from Muslim authorities in Morocco, American colonial policies in the Philippines, and American attempts to aid Christians during the Armenian Genocide. Walther examines the American role in the peace negotiations after World War I, support for the Balfour Declaration, and the establishment of the mandate system in the Middle East. The result is a vital exploration of the crucial role the United States played in the Islamic world during the long nineteenth century--an interaction that shaped a historical legacy that remains with us today.",

    "abstract": "Using hunter-gatherer societies as a focus, we argue for a heuristic continuumof egalitarian social systems ranging between relatively strong and weak forms. Weak egalitarianism is characterized by an absence of real political hierarchy, and limited differences between individuals in terms of rank, status, wealth, or power, while strongly egalitarian societies are characterized by these with some combination of powerful sharing and leveling norms, extensive formal networks of reciprocity spanning geographical regions, assertive social mechanisms of norm enforcement, and ritual practices designed to alleviate resulting social tensions. While weak forms of egalitarianism may result from some long-recognized properties of mobile foraging societies, such as group membership flexibility and universal access to both means of economic production and the means of coercion, we argue that strong egalitarianism emerged as a social strategy for coping with foraging risk at larger temporal and spatial scales. We conclude with a synthesis of ethnoarchaeological and archaeological approaches in the examination of the prehistoryof egalitarianism, as well as a brief consideration of potential evolutionarily implications. © W.

    "abstract": "Whereas political and cultural histories of the Mughal Sultanate (1526–1858) abound, the study of Islamic law under the state’s auspices is less clearly drawn. This article considers the reasons behind the dearth by outlining the process by which major archival collections came into being and critically evaluating the secondary works produced over the last century and half. It argues that two factors are primarily responsible: 1) the qualitative and quantitative paucity of extant documentation as a consequence of no Mughal state archives and the fact that contemporary collections originated with British colonialism; 2) the approach too often taken by historians of South Asia. Early secondary works make little to no distinction between treatises reflexive of legal theory and practice, while many late works compensate by considering theory entirely divorced from Mughal practice. For the study of Islamic law under the Mughals to progress, practical and theoretical obstacles must be overcome.",

    "abstract": "When it was founded in 2001, the current ruling party in Turkey, the Justice and Development Party (JDP), unequivocally declared its commitment to democracy and secularism (JDP 2014). Nevertheless, the party's implementation of reforms aimed at strengthening Turkey's democracy after coming to power in 2002 surprised many observers because the JDP's top leaders had been known Islamists. The speed and dedication with which the government introduced and implemented laws aimed at 'European-style normalization' even impressed the EU, leading to the historic decision of 17 December 2004 to open negotiations with Turkey for full membership (KirisÒ«i 2004). Such commitment seemed to be a rarity and therefore did not escape the attention of scholars either. It led to the publication of several academic works, four of which are the subject of this review essay.",

    "title": "Filiation or Affiliation? Nasser and Children in Egyptian Literature",
    "authorId": "bWH7NQfMuGBJmWf0zp8F",
    "abstract": "Among the growing number of literary works that have (re)-imagined the character of late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, several Egyptian novels and autobiographies have represented him through the eyes of children, who, in one way or another, directly were affected by his personality, decisions, speeches, or ideas. The perspective of children offers these works a rare opportunity to approach Nasser in ways that the world of adults may not. It can indicate the incomprehensibility of the situation in which children find themselves vis-à-vis Nasser. Children's incomplete knowledge of the political context of their lives, these works suggest, may drive them to adopt different responses toward Nasser than those advanced by their families. More importantly, I argue that these works capture the children's developing awareness of the significance of Nasser at moments of severe familial crises, during which their fathers emerge as the most negatively affected ones. In so doing, these works place children in an uncomfortable, unsettling position where the father's place loses its unassailable authority. The tension is all the more aggravated when the attack on the father at the hand of Nasser's regime is accompanied by the child's growing respect and love for Nasser. As this article will demonstrate, these works pit biological fathers against Nasser—the figurative father of the nation, children included—and, at times, demand a certain belonging from children. They, in other words, corner children between filiation and affiliation, in Edward Said's articulation of the terms, where the forced absence of the father is juxtaposed with a sudden presence of Nasser in the child's world. © 2015 Editors of Middle East Critique.",

    "abstract": "This article argues the following points. The Hobbesian hypothesis, which we define as the claim that all people are better off under state authority than they would be outside of it, is an empirical claim about all stateless societies. It is an essential premise in most contractarian justifications of government sovereignty. Many small-scale societies are stateless. Anthropological evidence from them provides sufficient reason to doubt the truth of the hypothesis, if not to reject it entirely. Therefore, contractarian theory has not done what it claims to do: it has not justified state sovereignty to each person subject to it by demonstrating that they benefit from that authority. To be justified in contractarian terms, states have to do something to improve the living standards of disadvantaged people under their rule. © Lucius & Lucius, Stuttgart.",

    "publicationAffiliation": "GU-Q",
    "pubId": "",
    "abstract": "Under the rule of Gamal Abdel Nasser from 1956 to 1970, The Voice of the Arabs or Sawt Al-Arab–a radio broadcasting program created by Nasser himself–played a prominent role in strengthening the Pan-Arabian identity, fueling anti-colonial sentiments and nationalist ideologists. This paper looks into the factors that led to the success of the radio as a medium of mass media, followed by a close analysis of the methods and forms of propaganda employed by Nasser through the radio program to promote and maintain these ideologies. Radio thrived within the Arab world as it was considered as an extension of cultural features rooted in the Arabic culture and one which complimented the tradition of oral communication. The region&apos;s familiarity with this media platform led them to overlook Nasser&apos;s true intentions. Such associations only masked the capacity for the people to recognize methods of propaganda which dominated the airwaves, in an effort to strengthen the gap between the state and society. Ultimately, this paper seeks to prove that The Voice of the Arabs played a significant role in enabling Gamal Abdel Nasser to maintain Pan-Arabism in the Middle East, as it was employed as state apparatus to spread propaganda, fueling an atmosphere of anti-colonial discontent and, amongst other ideas, the dissemination of nationalist ideologies.",

    "abstract": "To increase the opportunities for poor ethnic minorities to benefit from economic growth the government of Vietnam implemented a program entitled 'Socio-economic Development for the Communes Facing Greatest Hardships in the Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas' during 2006-2010. This paper provides empirical evidence of this program's impacts on households in the project areas. We find that the program had positive impacts on several important outcomes of the ethnic minority households, including productive asset ownership, household durables ownership, and rice productivity. Among higher-order outcomes, they enjoyed positive impacts in income from agriculture, household total income, and household per-capita income. A particularly important result is that poverty among minority households in treatment communes declined significantly more than it declined in control communes. Finally, ethnic minority households enjoyed a reduction in travel time to health facilities, relative to households in control communes. © 2014 Asian Development Bank.",

I argue in favor of the latter by giving evidence from Jordanian Arabic. Specifically, bipartite negation is between vP and TP while single negation is above TP. Syntactic and prosodic difference between the two patterns are taken as evidence for positing a different locus for each negation pattern. Crucially, I give semantic evidence that each negation type displays different scope readings. Single negation allows for only a wide scope reading of the time adverbial while bipartite negation allows for a narrow scope reading and may allow the wide scope reading. This is instantiated by the proposal that single negation binds a tense variable while bipartite negation binds an event variable. The explanatory power of the two negatives analysis is scrutinized under the empirical breadth produced by the interaction between the two negatives, the Negative Polarity Items and Negative Concord Items. The outcome of the analyses reflect explanatory adequacy for previously reported and new empirical observations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",

    "abstract": "The peculiar demographic situation in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states is assumed to have arisen as a consequence of the unique economic forces prevailing in this sub-region, where large stocks of temporary migrants are active in the overall labor market, and in three states foreigners outnumber the native population. The common understanding is that the influx of migrants to the Gulf countries has been driven by the transformative effect of oil and gas revenue. Gulf demography is considered a natural result of de facto economic conditions, where a paucity of local labor has come up against a region-wide booming, oil-driven development agenda. While accepting the primacy of economic forces in shaping the regional reliance on foreign labor, this paper suggests that the GCC's peculiar demography is also reflective of particular political choices made by the states. This paper examines two particular policymaking tools used widely across the region, namely — the kafāla (worker-sponsorship) system and public sector employment of citizens and assess them within the Qatari context. In Qatar, it appears that these policy tools have been state choices not only to preserve citizens’ economic satisfaction, but also political and social stability. © 2016, © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",

This is to show how the ever-changing systems of governance of the country coerced Iranian women into dressing in accordance with the political agenda at the time. This paper showcases women taking a stand against the system of governance before, during, and after the Iranian Revolution (18th to 21st century) by developing a subculture that does not confine them to certain kind of clothing. Instead, they mixed their personality with what they chose to wear, often identifying themselves as ‘bad hijabis’ for defying the status quo to make their own political statement.",

Yet its enormous oil and gas wealth has permitted the ruling al Thani family to exert a disproportionately large influence on regional and even international politics. Qatar is, as Mehran Kamrava explains in this knowledgeable and incisive account of the emirate, a 'tiny giant': although severely lacking in most measures of state power, it is highly influential in diplomatic, cultural, and economic spheres. Kamrava presents Qatar as an experimental country, building a new society while exerting what he calls 'subtle power.' It is both the headquarters of the global media network Al Jazeera and the site of the U.S. Central Command's Forward Headquarters and the Combined Air Operations Center. Qatar has been a major player during the European financial crisis, it has become a showplace for renowned architects, several U.S. universities have established campuses there, and it will host the FIFA World Cup in 2022. Qatar's effective use of its subtle power, Kamrava argues, challenges how we understand the role of small states in the global system. Given the Gulf state's outsized influence on regional and international affairs, this book is a critical and timely account of contemporary Qatari politics and society. ",

    "abstract": "Direct realist versions of foundationalism (hereafter, DRF) have recently been advocated by (among others) Pryor, Huemer, Alston, and Plantinga. DRF can hold either that our foundational observation beliefs are about the simple perceptible qualities of objects (like color, shape, etc.), or that our foundational observation beliefs are more complex ones about objects in the world. I will show that whether our observational beliefs are simple or complex, the agent must possess other epistemically significant states (knowledge, or justified beliefs) in order for these observational beliefs to be justified. These other states are therefore epistemically prior to observation belief, and prevent them from being epistemically foundational. © 2015 Philosophy Documentation Center.",

    "abstract": "We present a simple and tractable trade model of heterogeneous firms, endogenous quality choice, and endogenous markups. A key feature of the model is that competition not only lowers the cost cut-off between the firms that produce and those that exit, but it also raises the scope for quality differentiation. With both these channels present, the most productive firms respond to competition by raising quality, prices, and markups, while the least productive either exit or respond in the exact opposite manner.The model generates a unified theory and a supply-side explanation for an extremely rich set of stylized facts relating to (i) productivity heterogeneity, (ii) product quality heterogeneity, (iii) markups heterogeneity, (iv) heterogeneity in the response of firms to competition, and (v) heterogeneity in the sign and magnitude of the correlations between output prices, firm productivity, size, and product quality. In addition, the model predicts that average price and markups exhibit a U-shape response to competition and that imports from developed countries have higher quality, markups and prices when compared to imports from developing countries. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",

    "abstract": "Theorizing the nature and possibility of political opposition in the Arab Gulf states after the 'Arab Spring’ has largely focused on the state's capacity to dispense economic patronage to defuse any oppositional formation. Citing the lack of critical popular and public mobilization, many opted to focus only on the ‘resilience’ of the state, re-emphasizing the often-touted view of ‘Gulf exceptionalism’ under the rentier state social contract. Within this conceptual framework, the risk of political opposition only arises when the state is unable to expand economic entitlement to its populations. The aim of this article is to examine the forms and formations of religious-based oppositional discourse that can arise in a rentier state. More specifically, the goal of this article is to examine the dynamic oppositional narratives engendered by the Muslim Brotherhood against the government of the UAE after the ‘Arab Spring.’ One of the main assertions in this article is that this oppositional discourse transcended simple demands for political and economic participation and evolved into a broader form of de-legitimation discourse grounded in notions of social justice, identity rights, and civic entitlements. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.",

    "abstract": "This article has two objectives. Firstly, we test the theoretical assumptions about the repertoire of party strategies in a two-dimensional political space presented in the introduction to this special issue. We use a new dataset that content-analyzes electoral parties’ manifestos for regional elections in Spain and Great Britain (the Regional Manifestos Project) in order to see how well the theoretically-derived strategies approximate what parties in regional elections really do. Secondly, we develop tentative explanations of parties’ strategies: Which parties are more likely to use what type of strategy and under what circumstances? After running a multinomial logistic model we find that, in contrast to the niche party thesis, regionalist parties strategize simultaneously along the territorial and the economic dimensions of competition, while state-wide parties react to the presence of regionalist opponents by incorporating the territorial dimension into the agenda. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.",

Despite this consensus against surrogacy, jurists discuss in detail its potential effects if it is performed. This juristic attitude reflects an understanding of shariah as a legal system that not only institutes rules for cases that match its moral vision but also regulates the consequences of cases that do not match that vision. In the absence of clear and binding legislation on surrogacy in most Muslimmajority countries, this body of religious and ethical deliberations represents the main resource for moral decision-making on surrogacy and its impact on the genealogical connections within the nuclear family. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",

We find evidence of substantial reductions in firewood use and large savings. However, the attractiveness of the program is hampered by a long payback period and low rates of return.

While both types of Arabic learners strive to learn the same language, heritage learners almost certainly bring some cultural background and linguistic skills to the classroom, often giving them an advantage over second language learners. In order to appreciate and understand the unique qualities these students have, a 16-item survey was administered to incoming college-level heritage students for three consecutive academic years. It was designed to capture language background, exposure, skills and needs, and students’ reasons for studying Arabic. Addressing the needs of heritage speakers of Arabic in the classroom will allow them to reach higher proficiency levels at an accelerated rate. Ignoring these qualities will ultimately lead to high attrition rates.",

This article examines how efforts at secularization were repeatedly thwarted due to veto rights accorded to sectarian heads in the Lebanese Constitution. The codification of sectarian marriage and inheritance laws is related to Lebanon's confessional political system and to the attendant perpetuation of kinship ties and fluctuating confessional attitudes. The latter are measured and compared diachronically with a series of surveys. Paradoxically, the chronic weakness of the Lebanese state would render top-down reform measures an exceedingly difficult task even as it opened the space for increasingly effective civil society activism aimed at dismantling the juridical hegemony of the sects. © Koninklijke Brill NV, 2015.",

    "abstract": "Islam is not merely a religion; it expands beyond that to include almost everything. Politics and Islam have always had a fickle relationship, yet a somewhat more stable one in the past. This was due mainly to the fact that Islam existed as an underlying foundation to societal life and basic political interactions;1 today, things have developed in such a manner that Islam has been institutionalized into either state-inclusive bodies that exist on a political bargain or de-facto opposition basis, or criminal groups that are deemed to be enemies of the state. Islam as an all-inclusive way of life for people is now merely a reflection of whatever these new Islamic institutions dictate. The way in which these Islamic institutions came into existence and their political relationship with the state presents us with a very interesting yet “locked” paradigm of existence, whereby a huge gap forms between the state and society. In order to understand how this paradigm came into being, this paper will go through the process of explaining and analyzing the different groups, mechanisms and structures that changed the application of Islam in the Middle East. Using the work of Anwar Majid&apos;s Freedom and Orthodoxy as a theoretical framework, the paper will first examine the rise of the Ulama class and their role in the process of Islamic state institutionalization. The paper will then move on to show how Islamic legal authority was transferred from society and given to the state, with the Ulama class being the new keepers of this authority, and how the colonial encroachment of Western laws was the vehicle of this transfer. That is not to say that pre-colonial Islamic societies were model ones and that colonialism is the direct cause of this transfer. Finally, the paper will examine the process",

    "abstract": "In this critical examination of the famous South Asian thinker Nirad C. Chaudhuri (1897-1999), a notorious Anglophile and defender of Empire, Ian Almond analyses the factors that played a role in the evolution of his thought. Almond explores how Empire creates 'native informants ', enabling local subjects to alienate themselves from and even abhor their own cultures. Through analysis of Chaudhuri's views on Islam, his use of the archive, moments of melancholy and loss in his writing, and his opinions on Empire, Almond dissects the constitution of an Indian writer and locates the precise ways in which Chaudhuri was able to produce the kind of discourses he did, exploring how conservative, pro-Western intellectuals are formed in postcolonial environments. A strong comparative element places Chaudhuri's views in the context of conservative intellectuals from Latin America, the Middle East and South Asia, concluding with a consideration of present-day ‘native informants ' from these regions. © Ian Almond 2015.",

    "abstract": "US Democracy Promotion in the Middle East seeks to explore the changes in US strategy towards democracy promotion in the Middle East during the Clinton and Bush administrations, with a particular focus on Egypt, Iraq and Kuwait. At a time of regional turmoil and political reform, the topic of democracy promotion has never been more pertinent. We are witnessing the emergence of popular movements that are challenging authoritarian governments long supported by the US. Tracing the contours of the ongoing transition in US policy in the Middle East, this book critically deconstructs the strategy of democracy promotion on both a theoretical and empirical level. By formulating and applying an analytical framework derived from a Gramscian approach, Markakis seeks to propose a re-evaluation of what US foreign policy in the Middle East truly constitutes, critiquing both the ideological foundations of the strategy as well as the implementation. This book will provide a solid foundation for the analysis of US policy and in particular the strategy of democracy promotion at this time of momentous transition across the region. © 2016 Dionysis Markakis.

    "abstract": "Thomas Piketty's recent book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, provides a great deal of empirical support for the observation that the rate of return on capital (r) is greater than the growth rate of the economy as a whole (g); i.e. 'r > g'. From this observation, Piketty derives two important insights: entrepreneurs eventually become rentiers, and except during unusual circumstances, inequality tends to rise over time. This paper views Piketty's observation against the institutional setting that has prevailed over the period of his study and makes two additional observations. First, whether Piketty's two insights follow from his observation depends not simply on whether r is greater than g, but on whether the difference between the two is greater than the consumption of the capital-owning group. The relative size of capitalists' consumption and capital income is not obvious, and therefore, more evidence is needed to confirm the connection between Piketty's observation and his insights. Second, the statement r has been greater than g is more accurate than simply r is greater than g. Whether r continues to exceed g depends crucially on the political and institutional environment in question. Economists tend to view one specific institutional setting, a version of laissez faire, as natural. But there is no natural set of property institutions, and those that have prevailed over the two centuries of Piketty's observations are extremely favorable to capital owners. Awareness of the flexibility of potential property institutions raises many ethical questions and makes many tools available to address inequality-one of the most obvious being the taxation of rent on capital distributed as a basic income. © 2015 by De Gruyter.",

Socioeconomic status does not inhibit uptake and food-insecure households are more likely to enroll. Chronic diseases and self-assessed health status do not induce enrollment, while past expenditure does. A relative novelty is the identification of quality of care. Both the availability of equipment and waiting time to see medical professionals substantially influences enrollment. Focus-groups raise concerns about providers favoring uninsured households.

    "abstract": "With the coming to power of King Mohamed VI, the feminist movement in Morocco has aided the process of democratization as well as the politicization of women&apos;s issues in the country. A key success in the acknowledgment of women&apos;s rights and a significant attempt to empower women and increase their agency in both the public and private spheres has been the enactment of the new Family Code of 2004. This paper aims at exploring the ways in which the Family Code has increased women&apos;s freedom within the family despite the persistence of tradition, and has enhanced their voice in regards to reproductive health, and the number and spacing of their children. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the limitations that women face within the labor force, giving emphasis to the problems of mobility and the two-fold effect of economic globalization on women in Export Processing Zones.",

In a nutshell, we maintain that in contemporary Spain there is real demand for PRR parties, but three supply-side factors are impeding their electoral breakthrough and persistence: the cleavage structure of the country, the strategy of competition of the mainstream right and the electoral system. At the same time, we postulate that at least in the case of Spain the Great Recession has not improved the electoral odds of the PRR as such but rather facilitated the emergence of leftist populist forces. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",

    "abstract": "In 2011, in an attempt to increase access to health care and reduce household vulnerability to out-of-pocket health expenditure, the Government of Ethiopia launched a Community- Based Health Insurance Scheme (CBHI). This paper uses three rounds of household survey data, collected before and after the introduction of the CBHI pilot, to assess the impact of the scheme on household consumption, income, indebtedness, and livestock holdings.We find that enrollment leads to a 5 percentage point-or 13%-decline in the probability of borrowing and is associated with an increase in household income. There is no evidence that enrolling in the scheme affects consumption or livestock holdings. Our results show that the scheme reduces reliance on potentially harmful coping responses such as borrowing. This paper adds to the relatively small body of work that rigorously evaluates the impact of CBHI schemes on economic welfare. © The Author 2015.",

    "abstract": "Low contract renewal rates have been identified as one of the challenges facing the development of community-based health insurance (CBHI) schemes. This article uses longitudinal household survey data gathered in 2012 and 2013 to examine dropout in the case of Ethiopia's pilot CBHI scheme. We treat dropout as a function of scheme affordability, health status, scheme understanding and quality of care. The scheme saw enrolment increase from 41% 1 year after inception to 48% a year later. An impressive 82% of those who enrolled in the first year renewed their subscriptions, while 25% who had not enrolled joined the scheme. The analysis shows that socioeconomic status, a greater understanding of health insurance and experience with and knowledge of the CBHI scheme are associated with lower dropout rates. While there are concerns about the quality of care and the treatment meted out to the insured by providers, the overall picture is that returns from the scheme are overwhelmingly positive. For the bulk of households, premiums do not seem to be onerous, basic understanding of health insurance is high and almost all those who are currently enrolled signalled their desire to renew contracts. © The Author 2015; all rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "We study the response of markets to a firm-specific shock in a natural experiment setting. In 2006, a boycott of Danish products in several Arab countries was devastating for Danish cheese firms. In Saudi Arabia their market share collapsed from 16.5% in January to <1% in March and never fully recovered: it was 6.3% in 2009. By analyzing micro-level (scanner) price and expenditure data we find that (i) Danish firms lowered prices but kept the product mix the same; (ii) non-Danish firms kept prices constant but changed their product mix by introducing new products and new product bundles; and (iii) non-Danish firms chose to introduce products that were identical to the Danish in order to compete head-to-head. The finding that Danish firms adjusted to the negative demand shock through the intensive margin and non-Danish to the positive through the extensive is hard to reconcile with existing pricing theories or theories on multi-product firms. We offer two potential explanations that can help reconcile our findings with existing models.",

    "abstract": "Thinking of the interconnections between water, food, energy and climate is nothing new in the Nile Basin; it has long been anchored in political struggles. For 200 years, Egypt's political economy has been defined by water use patterns and food security strategies that debunk the technocratic myth that rapid growth, interaction with global markets and technological modernization eliminate poor governance practices and allocative inefficiencies. In contrast, the prism of the nexus as a political commodity illuminates one of modern Egypt's most consequential dialectics: the interaction between the very particular nexus at the heart of the country's political economy, forged through factional strife and sustained by outside discourses and interests, and the economic and ecological ravages of this elite politics. Egyptian history serves as a warning. Today's conversation needs to be deconstructed in terms of how different forms of interconnectivity between water, energy and food are produced and experienced by different social groups. It reminds us to take interconnections not as given, but rather as contested and contestable outcomes from which opportunities for adaptation and transformation do not naturally emerge, but need to be struggled for. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",

    "abstract": "This Culture and Politics senior thesis examines and compares the imagined and the lived experience of the city, using Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon, as a model. In a neo-liberal city such as Beirut, group formations can be engaged in multiple hegemonies that affect and define the ‘urban’ city experience. In this thesis, I will label two major group-formations in Beirut that shape its urban experience: the ‘Urbanistas’ and the ‘Biarts.’ The Urbanistas are an affluent upper-class group that imagines a ‘global’ and worldly Beirut that is in connection to the rest of the world. This group then lives its ‘social imaginaire’ of the city in a tightly confined upper-class conceptual map of the downtown, the Zaytouna Bay Area and Rue du Verdun. The Biartis on the other hand, a lower-income group, represent the lived experience of Beirut, living a city of manifestations, contradictions and concerns. I will argue that both groups exhibit a form of hegemony in their city, albeit a different one, and interact with each other in different ways. To explore the role of these groups in the social production of the city, this thesis analyzes interviews with Urbanistas and Biartis, participant observation of the socio- spatial habits of these groups, media coverage of Beirut and advertisement, pictorials and street art within enclaves of the city. Due to the multiple hegemonies of these groups, the ‘global’ city should no longer be taken to be identical to its image. Groups such as the Urbanistas, wishing to engage in a global and capitalist experience of urban city life, present a singular image of cities that is an imagined reflection of them. While groups such as the Biartis, have an inward looking experience, shaping the notion of the city through their daily lived occurrences.",

    "abstract": "This article assesses insurance uptake in three community-based health insurance (CBHI) schemes located in rural parts of two of India's poorest states and offered through women's self-help groups (SHGs). We examine what drives uptake, the degree of inclusive practices of the schemes and the influence of health status on enrolment. The most important finding is that a household's socio-economic status does not appear to substantially inhibit uptake. In some cases scheduled caste/scheduled tribe households are more likely to enrol. Second, households with greater financial liabilities find insurance more attractive. Third, access to the national hospital insurance scheme Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana does not dampen CBHI uptake, suggesting that the potential for greater development of insurance markets and products beyond existing ones would respond to a need. Fourth, recent episodes of illness and self-assessed health status do not influence uptake. Fifth, insurance coverage is prioritized within households, with the household head, the spouse of the household head and both male and female children of the household head, more likely to be insured as compared with other relatives. Sixth, offering insurance through women's SHGs appears to mitigate concerns about the inclusiveness and sustainability of CBHI schemes. Given the pan-Indian spread of SHGs, offering insurance through such groups offers the potential to scale-up CBHI. © 2013 Published by Oxford University Press in association with The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine © The Author 2013.",

    "abstract": "This paper is about the power of representation; it takes as specific focus an animal who has been made out to represent all that is impure in Islamic discourses. Not only are dogs regarded as unclean animals, but their entry into a person's home has been described to be a cause for refusal of angels to enter that home. In other words, good Muslims have to stay away from them. This is odd when the actual history and life of dogs among Arabs is studied, for without dogs Arab merchants trekking over long desert route and peaceful sleeping peasantry all over the Islamic world could not have been protected from attackers, thieves and evil-doers except for vigilant dogs attached to the people involved. Moreover, it is a clear contradiction that the representation of dogs as unclean animals is mostly based on fiqh when in fact the Holy Qur'an has honored the dog in Surat al-Kahf. This paper will discuss these contradictions and discuss the actual place of the dog in Islamic and Arab history and contemporary life to illustrate the contradictions between representation and reality. While this article is not about gender, it is closely related to moral discourses involving women and canines. It is perhaps not coincidental that the last thirty years have seen the anti-dog discourse reach such momentum at the same time as the call for the niqab and the seclusion of women; it is the same voices and groups that seem to espouse both, being conservatively dressed, religiously inclined and observant, and dog-hating seem to go together. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",

    "abstract": "While food prices have dropped since the 2008 highs, they remain significantly higher than before the food crisis. Expert opinion suggests that this will continue to be the case as the factors that led to elevated costs in the first place have not been adequately dealt with. Bio-fuel production programs continue to be encouraged in major grain-producing countries; global grain reserves have not been sufficiently enhanced in the intervening years; and food supplies have not kept pace with the increasing demands arising out of higher per capita incomes and changing consumption patterns in certain parts of the developing world. In specific relation to the Middle East, several structural factors particular to the region are likely to continue to aggravate issues of food insecurity and food sovereignty.",

    "abstract": "This book analyses both the historic trajectories of agricultural development in the Middle East, and how the globalisation of food production has impacted domestic food security and food sovereignty. The volume draws on original research conducted on the causes and consequences of food security in the Middle East at national and regional levels as well as household and individual levels. Impacting the formulation of thinking on food security in the Middle East is a historical memory of food shortages and dependency on food aid schemes. If past economic and political factors led to disruptions in food availability, this provides a rationale for why Middle Eastern states might currently be considering means by which to achieve food self-sufficiency. A central theme throughout this volume centres on the impact rentier earnings have had on the development of agriculture in the Middle East or on the lack of domestic investment in the sector. Other topics include historic food regimes; the political economy of food; urban agriculture; Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) investments in foreign agriculture; the supermarket transition; food insecurity in the West Bank; the nutrition transition and obesity in Qatar; among other theoretical and empirical studies.",

    "abstract": "This groundbreaking book examines the means by which the Muslim Brotherhood was reconstituted during the years of Anwar al-Sadat’s presidency. By including an analysis of structural, ideological, and social developments during this period in the history of the Islamic movement, a more accurate picture of the so-called Islamic resurgence develops, one that represents the rebirth of an old idea in a new setting. The Muslim Brotherhood’s success in rebuilding its organization rested in large part on its ability to attract a new generation of Islamic activists who had transformed Egypt’s colleges and universities into a hub for religious contention against the state. Led by groups such as al-Gama‘a al-Islamiyyah (the Islamic Society), the student movement exhibited a dynamic and vibrant culture of activism that found inspiration in a multitude of intellectual and organizational sources, of which the Muslim Brotherhood was only one. By the close of the 1970s, however, internal divisions over ideology and strategy led to the rise of factionalism within the student movement. A majority of student leaders opted to expand the scope of their activist mission by joining the Muslim Brotherhood, rejuvenating the struggling organization, and launching a new phase in its history.",

More particularly, it seeks to examine the extent to which DNA testing can be equated with the classical method of physiognomy (qiyāfa) as its modern equivalent. Depending on whether such a relationship can be drawn, Sharīa ruling on the former will be no different from its ruling on the latter. Although the majority opinion of modern Muslim jurists recognizes DNA testing as a reliable scientific method that can be used, to varying degrees, for paternity verification, such recognition is made by appeal to Islamic legal methodology and within the boundaries defined by it. The paper thus illustrates not only the extent to which DNA analysis is legitimized but also the efforts of Muslim jurists to enable the Islamic law of paternity to cope with modern scientific challenges. © 2013 The Author.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes Iran’s evolving interest and geopolitical challenges to its foreign policy in Central Eurasia. Historically, Iran, Turkey,and Russia have wielded the greatest influence in Central Asia and the Caucasus region. Therefore, it is not surprising that these three countries reemerged as principal actors in the region during the first decade of the post-Soviet era. Since the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union, Iran performed a balancing act. That is, it aspired to develop closer relations with a region with which it shared significant historical and cultural ties. At the same time, Russia regards Central Eurasia as its sphere of influence and would like to keep the “intruders” at bay. Hence, the United States’ expanding presence in the region has added a new twist to Iran’s geopolitical calculations in how to define its policy toward the region. Turkish-Iranian cooperation and competition in the region is yet another piece in the strategic triangle that molds Iranian regional political posture. The looming impact of these three countries aside, as an emerging regional power with its own political agenda, perception, and calculus of its interests, Iran uses identity politics and shared cultural and religious values, where appropriate, to forge closer relations with Central Eurasian countries. Beyond this motif in Iran’s foreign policy, this paper concentrates on political, economic, and strategic variables affecting Iran’s foreign policy decisions in Central Eurasia. Islamic factors are treated as variables within the broader context of sociocultural factors that have played a role in shaping Iran’s foreign policy in the region.",

    "abstract": "Background: Our research investigates the impact of the sudden profusion of internet media and other forms of global communications on family values in Qatar. The majority of mass communications and sociological research has focused on examining the media content and the audience of the media in the United States and Europe. However, documentation on the societal consequences of the dissemination of internet media and other forms of mass communication on Arab, and in particular Gulf countries such as Qatar, remains scarce. The particular placement of Qatar at the heart of the crosscurrents of globalization affords a unique opportunity to examine this phenomenon. Objective: This paper attempts to gauge to what degree global communications are driving individualism a modern sense of citizenship and national identity, and to what degree the weakening of family solidarities may have adverse consequences for communal identities and the fabric of households and the nation as a whole. Methodology: The centerpiece of our research is a survey that attempts to determine inter-generational and inter-class differentials, evaluating the impact of the global communications revolution on the public discourse on family values, as well as on broader social dynamics within the Qatari nationstate. The sample consisted of 54 respondents. Further, a literature review was set to determine the theoretical framework of whether consumption of global communications leads to greater individualization and cultural homogenization alike. Results: A pattern of cultural homogenization towards the post-industrial model of greater individualism can be observed in a Qatari society permeated with ICT media, even if we have discerned numerous attempts to streamline and attenuate this overarching process by a set of cultural firewalls. Conclusions: Our research concluded that Qatar finds itself very much in the twilight zone of modernity, witnessing a bewildering pace of expanding realms of knowledge through ICT and educational institutions, yet still evincing a deep desire to hold on to traditional values and identity references. This study therefore challenges the determinism of modernization, globalization or convergence theories, which predict that traditional norms and worldviews and distinctive national and religious identities will be eroded by the exposure to global streams of knowledge.",

Five strategies for deconstructing the idea of Europe are considered: re-origination, re-configuration, provincialization/de-universalization, fissuring through internal Othering and strategies of commonality. Each of these strategies, be they philosophical, philological, historical or geographical, tries to undermine the notion of 'Europe' as a self-contained space, either by alienating its origins, splitting it into alternative topographies, reducing it to just another language game, revealing its internal differences or showing how many of its features spill over into adjacent cultural spaces. The essay ends with some thoughts on what the consequences of a deconstructed Europe might be. © The Author(s) 2013.",

    "abstract": "The Euro-Arab Dialogue (EAD) was established by the European Economic Community in 1974 as a way of improving bilateral relations between Europe and the Arab world in the wake of the October 1973 Arab-Israeli War and the subsequent global energy crisis. This article examines the success of the EAD in its first three years in existence (between 1974 and 1977). It begins with an analysis of the literature on the framework in these years. Much of this material argues that the EAD was a success in achieving its goal of improving relations with the Arab world as well as evidence of the success of the recently established European Political Cooperation (EPC) framework in general. This article challenges this view and instead argues that the EAD, even in its early years, was not a success due to three factors: the first was the failure of the EEC to keep the EAD focused on economic issues and to prevent the politicization of the framework; the second was the Community's inability to come to grips with the deep internal divisions over both the mandate and goals of the EAD; and the third was American hostility towards the EAD from the time of its birth. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.",

All that needed to be done for the one-legged bargain to collapse—in fact for the whole basis of rule to crumble—was for the grip of mass fear to be broken. And, when that happened, the Arab Spring followed. The chapter then provides a summary of the series of uprisings that came to be known as the Arab Spring, and how and why the Tunisian Revolution and Egyptian Revolution unfolded in the form of mass-based uprisings while the Libyan and Syrian rebellions took the form of civil wars. The chapter ends with a discussion of what the central elements of emerging sources of legitimacy—the evolving ruling bargain—are likely to be.",

    "abstract": "This book analyses both the historic trajectories of agricultural development in the Middle East, and how the globalisation of food production has impacted domestic food security and food sovereignty. The volume draws on original research conducted on the causes and consequences of food security in the Middle East at national and regional levels as well as household and individual levels. Impacting the formulation of thinking on food security in the Middle East is a historical memory of food shortages and dependency on food aid schemes. If past economic and political factors led to disruptions in food availability, this provides a rationale for why Middle Eastern states might currently be considering means by which to achieve food self-sufficiency. A central theme throughout this volume centres on the impact rentier earnings have had on the development of agriculture in the Middle East or on the lack of domestic investment in the sector. Other topics include historic food regimes; the political economy of food; urban agriculture; Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) investments in foreign agriculture; the supermarket transition; food insecurity in the West Bank; the nutrition transition and obesity in Qatar; among other theoretical and empirical studies.",

It argues that Islamic bioethics can be viewed both as a cumulative tradition building on the Islamic ethical resources and as an ongoing discourse that captures the effort to understand and implement Islamic moral precepts pertaining to a wide range of issues including the beginning and end of human life, treatment of the human body, and proper attitudes towards the environment. After a brief introduction on the term 'bioethics' and its history, the article is divided into three main sections exploring the foundations of Islamic (bio)ethics, the evolution and development of medical ethics in the Islamic tradition, and the main challenges confronting contemporary Islamic bioethical discourses.",

    "abstract": "How can the Absolute conceivably be side by side with the existence of 'non-absolute' realities given that such a 'co-existence' would perforce imply some sort of 'relationality' between the former and the latter, and thereby run contrary to the notion of an unconditionally free and necessary ab-solutum? This is the main question pondered in this essay through a liminal survey of some of the most rigorous concepts of the Absolute provided by a cross-religious spectrum of metaphysical teachings that include ͆ankara's Advaita, Na¯ga¯rjuna's Madhyamaka, Kashmiri ͆aivism, and the Sufi school of 'Unity of Being' (wahdat al-wuju¯d). ͆an. kara provides a fitting starting point for this analysis of the ontological status of 'other-than-the-Ultimate' when characterizing Ma¯ya¯ as 'neither real nor unreal' in his Crest Jewel of Discrimination. These perplexing words will be used as keys to argue that wisdom and mystical traditions tend to assign an ambiguous ontological status to phenomenal realities. Furthermore, it is proposed here to show that each of these traditions does emphasize one of the two aforesaid characterizations in its approach to the mystery of universal metaphysical relativity, or universal existence: neither 'being' (or real) nor 'nonbeing' (or unreal). © 2014 by University of Hawai'i Press.",

Part 1 begins with a chapter that traces the rise and fall of ruling bargains in the Middle East and the growing primacy of only one of the elements of the ruling bargain, namely fear, as the main tool of governance across the Middle East and especially the Arab world, a process which began in the 1960s and 1970s and lasted into the 2000s. Part 2 begins with Nader Hashemi’s analysis of Iran’s 2009 Green Movement, which is not generally considered to be part of the Arab Spring. But the Green Movement did represent a popular, mass-based effort to reformulate the ruling bargain that had evolved under the Iranian Islamic Republic over the preceding thirty years. It then examines Egypt’s Tahrir Square revolution, the region’s monarchies and their resilience to revolution. The book ends by considering Islamist groups, the situation in Syria, and Libya’s future.",

    "abstract": "Background: Our research investigates the impact of the sudden profusion of internet media and other forms of global communications on family values in Qatar. The majority of mass communications and sociological research has focused on examining the media content and the audience of the media in the United States and Europe. However, documentation on the societal consequences of the dissemination of internet media and other forms of mass communication on Arab, and in particular Gulf countries such as Qatar, remains scarce. The particular placement of Qatar at the heart of the crosscurrents of globalization affords a unique opportunity to examine this phenomenon. Objective: This paper attempts to gauge to what degree global communications are driving individualism a modern sense of citizenship and national identity, and to what degree the weakening of family solidarities may have adverse consequences for communal identities and the fabric of households and the nation as a whole. Methodology: The centerpiece of our research is a survey that attempts to determine inter-generational and inter-class differentials, evaluating the impact of the global communications revolution on the public discourse on family values, as well as on broader social dynamics within the Qatari nationstate. The sample consisted of 54 respondents. Further, a literature review was set to determine the theoretical framework of whether consumption of global communications leads to greater individualization and cultural homogenization alike. Results: A pattern of cultural homogenization towards the post-industrial model of greater individualism can be observed in a Qatari society permeated with ICT media, even if we have discerned numerous attempts to streamline and attenuate this overarching process by a set of cultural firewalls. Conclusions: Our research concluded that Qatar finds itself very much in the twilight zone of modernity, witnessing a bewildering pace of expanding realms of knowledge through ICT and educational institutions, yet still evincing a deep desire to hold on to traditional values and identity references. This study therefore challenges the determinism of modernization, globalization or convergence theories, which predict that traditional norms and worldviews and distinctive national and religious identities will be eroded by the exposure to global streams of knowledge.",

Relatively covariate natural and economic shocks trigger reductions in savings and in food consumption, while relatively idiosyncratic health shocks prompt reductions in savings and a reliance on borrowing. Surprisingly, across all shocks, households do not rely on gifts from family and friends, highlighting the need for formal protection systems. We argue that the insensitivity of food consumption to health shocks does not imply insurability but indicates that it is not a viable response to such a shock. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",

    "abstract": "There was something of a dress rehearsal “Arab Spring” in early 2005, after which a ruling bargain emerged between the governed and those governing aimed at consolidating state-society relationships and maintaining various forms of authoritarian rule. In broad terms, this implicit bargain under-writing political rule has been one in which citizens surrender their political and social rights to participatory government, are expected to accept the legitimacy of the ruling regime, however begrudgingly, and in return are rewarded with a variety of goods and services, most of them tangible but some also intangible, as well as socio-economic benefits. While much of the academic literature has been devoted to the durability of these ruling bargains, current events would indicate that inadequate attention has been given to the potential causes of their erosion. The chapters in this volume probe some of the existing analytical assumptions and develop a new understanding of the drivers of the historic change in the Middle East beginning in late 2010 and early 2011.",

    "abstract": "In the 1920s and the 1930s, Turkey, Iran and Russia vehemently pursued state-secularizing reforms, but adopted different strategies in doing so. But why do states follow different secularizing strategies? The literature has already shattered the illusion that secularization of the state has been a unilinear, homogeneous and universal process, and has convincingly shown that secularization of the state has unfolded along different paths. Much, however, remains to be uncovered, This book provides an in-depth comparative historical analysis of state secularization in three major Eurasian countries: Turkey, Iran and Russia. To capture the aforementioned variation in state secularization across three countries that have been hitherto analyzed as separate studies, Birol Baskan adopts three modes of state secularization: accommodationism, separationism and eradicationism. Focusing thematically on the changing relations between the state and religious institutions, Baskan brings together a host of factors, historical, strategic and structural, to account for why Turkey adopted accommodationism, Iran separationism and Russia eradicationism. In doing so, he expertly demonstrates that each secularization strategy was a rational response to the strategic context the reformers found themselves in. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",

    "abstract": "This book analyses both the historic trajectories of agricultural development in the Middle East, and how the globalisation of food production has impacted domestic food security and food sovereignty. The volume draws on original research conducted on the causes and consequences of food security in the Middle East at national and regional levels as well as household and individual levels. Impacting the formulation of thinking on food security in the Middle East is a historical memory of food shortages and dependency on food aid schemes. If past economic and political factors led to disruptions in food availability, this provides a rationale for why Middle Eastern states might currently be considering means by which to achieve food self-sufficiency. A central theme throughout this volume centres on the impact rentier earnings have had on the development of agriculture in the Middle East or on the lack of domestic investment in the sector. Other topics include historic food regimes; the political economy of food; urban agriculture; Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) investments in foreign agriculture; the supermarket transition; food insecurity in the West Bank; the nutrition transition and obesity in Qatar; among other theoretical and empirical studies.",

    "abstract": "This chapter charts the evolution of political Islam in the Arab world and, in particular, highlights its growing engagement with the state. The decades of experience of groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood provide a rich pool of data from which one can draw more careful conclusions regarding the movement’s posture in a post-authoritarian setting. Some Islamist groups, long considered to be revolutionary forces in Arab societies, have transformed into reform-minded organizations and found some accommodation with the region’s authoritarian regimes. Islamic movements by and large broadened the scope of their missions and adopted the popular refrain of “dignity, freedom, and social justice,” around which millions of fellow citizens had united. This chapter also looks at long-term trends developing out of the contributions of Islamist movements to the emerging governance structures across the Arab world. Specifically, the interpretations of the Shari’a, the understanding of the nature of the civil state, and the shape of democratic participation are set to define future modes of governance. Internally, the Islamist movement faces its own challenges, attempting to temper its traditional ideology to the changing political realities, while also adapting its organizational structure to meet the needs of a democratic society.",

Bush to Barack Obama, from Rashid Ganouchi to Hillary Clinton has in fact viewed Turkey in that role.

Applying this approach to Vietnam, I investigate the impact of agriculture trade liberalisation between 1993 and 1998 on overall household welfare, measured using per capita household expenditure. I find that accounting for labour market imperfections results in welfare gains that are nearly four times larger than those found when assuming complete labour markets. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To investigate the determinants of healthcare-seeking behaviour using five contextrelevant clinical vignettes. The analysis deals with three issues: whether and where to seek modern care and when to seek care. Setting: This study is set in 96 villages located in four main regions of Ethiopia. The participants of this study are 1632 rural households comprising 9455 individuals. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Probability of seeking modern care for symptoms related to acute respiratory infections/pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, tetanus and tuberculosis. Conditional on choosing modern healthcare, where to seek care (health post, health centre, clinic and hospital). Conditional on choosing modern healthcare, when to seek care (seek care immediately, the next day, after 2 days, between 3 days to 1 week, a week or more). Results: We find almost universal preference for modern care. Foregone care ranges from 0.6% for diarrhoea to 2.5% for tetanus. There is a systematic relationship between socioeconomic status and choice of providers mainly for adult-related conditions with households in higher consumption quintiles more likely to seek care in health centres, private/Non-Government Organization (NGO) clinics as opposed to health posts. Delays in care-seeking behaviour are apparent mainly for adult-related conditions and among poorer households. Conclusions: The analysis suggests that the lack of healthcare utilisation is not driven by the inability to recognise health problems or due to a low perceived need for modern care.",

    "abstract": "In Islamic law paternity is treated as a consequence of a licit sexual relationship. Since DNA testing makes a clear distinction between legal and biological paternity possible, it challenges the continued correlation between paternity and marriage. This article explores the foundations of paternity regulations in the Islamic ethico-legal tradition, with a particular focus on what is termed here 'the licit sex principle,' and investigates the extent to which a harm-based argument can be made either by appeal to or against Islamic paternity regulations. It argues that in Islamic bioethics the definition of harm and its boundaries is a function of both: (1) identification of legal and religious rights and the extent to which these rights are violated; and (2) balancing and reconciling perceived harm against both specific principles in relation to a given issue and also the overarching objectives of Islamic law. The article is divided into three main sections addressing the Islamic legal, ethical, and bioethical dimensions of paternity. © 2013 by the Joint Publication Board of Zygon.",

    "abstract": "What conditions are the most conducive for religious and secular groups to overcome their mutualfears and suspicions towards each other? This article addresses this question through a comparative historical analysis of two major cases from the Middle East: Turkey and Egypt. The article argues that institutional differences in state-religion relations explain why Turkish religious groups, but not their Egyptian counter-parts, could better alleviate the fears and suspicions of the other secular groups. In summary, Turkey and Egypt instituted their state-religion relations in different ways while building their modern states and therefore entered the highly politicized environment of the 1970s under different state-religion relations. Institutional state-religion relations in Egypt have provided a venue for Islamic groups to Islamize the state and society using state power if necessary. This came at great cost, however. Religious groups in fact pushed further away the other societal groups, deepening their fears and suspicions. Institutional state-religion relations have not provided a venue for Islamic groups in Turkey to Islamize the state and society from top to bottom. Lacking state power to correct practices and norms deemed un-Islamic helped the Islamists and Islamic groups in the long run. Their relations with other societal groups have not deteriorated to the extent they have done in Egypt. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

    "abstract": "This volume brings together ethnographers conducting research on children living in crisis situations in both developing and developed regions, taking a cross-cultural approach that spans different cities in the global North and South to provide insight and analyses into the lifeworlds of their young, at-risk inhabitants. Looking at the lived experiences of poverty, drastic inequality, displacement, ecological degradation and war in countries including Haiti, Argentina and Palestine, the book shows how children both respond to and are shaped by their circumstances. Going beyond conventional images of children subjected to starvation, hunger, and disease to build an integrated analysis of what it means to be a child in crisis in the 21st century, the book makes a significant contribution to the nascent field of study concerned with development and childhood. With children now at the forefront of debates on human rights and poverty reduction, there is no better time for scholars, policymakers and the general public to understand the complex social, economic and political dynamics that characterize their present predicaments and future life chances. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

    "abstract": "The most significant contribution of Dr. Sirajul Husain is a theory of consciousness that has offered solutions to the three major unsolved problems in Cognitive Science: How a conscious experience arises in a physical brain, how it acquires meaning, and how meaning is represented in the brain. His research marks a major paradigm shift by his introduction of a non-reductionist approach to the phenomenon of consciousness as the foundation of cognition. His insightful prediction of a novel society of non-coding genes as a non-reductive source for emergence of consciousness, (International Conference on 'Toward a Science of Consciousness', University of Arizona, 2004) was based on his conviction that consciousness cannot be reduced to brain physiology, and that it emerges as a field, with neurobiology essentially acting as a neurocatalyst. His prediction was duly fulfilled by a monumental discovery of a set of forty nine non-coding genes, (University of California, Santa Cruz, 2006), in particular, RNA gene (HAR1F), which was found to be responsible for development of human cerebral cortex, the centre of cognitive process. These favorable circumstances led Dr. Husain to develop a unified cognitive field theory of consciousness, which mathematically describes the cognitive kinematics of how meaning arrives in a conscious experience and how it is represented, essentially independent of a language. In order to account for semantic relativistic effect that arises when conscious experiences are expressed using a natural languages, Dr. Husain propounded a non-Euclidean, four-dimensional curved space, termed sense-sound continuum, comprising of auditory, visual, somatosensory, and sound, for conserving semantic invariance of a conscious experience. Dr. Husain's interdisciplinary research in consciousness and cognitive science has a far reaching impact on several disciplines, from reconciliation of theory of relativity and quantum mechanics to a theory of everything, from psychiatry to mind-body medicine, and from cosmology to theology. However, by far the most significant aspect of his research is toward a theory of human mind, the most efficient, self-regulating system in nature that is known to function at negative entropy. One can say we are entering an Era of the Mind, vis-à-vis the 'Decade of the Brain', of the nineties.",

    "abstract": "Saudi Arabia has positioned itself among the primary mediators in some of the Middle East's most intractable conflicts, having played central mediatory roles in Lebanon, Palestine, and in Arab-Israeli conflict. Compared with the mediation efforts of another frequent regional mediator, namely Qatar, Saudi mediation initiatives tend to be more institutionally grounded and are less personal in nature, and often involve less fanfare and are more discreet. At the same time, the Kingdom is not always readily identified with its satellite media network of Al Arabiya in the same way that Qatari foreign policy is perceived to be closely aligned with Al Jazeera coverage. Although such efforts have seldom resulted in successful resolution of conflicts among the disputants involved, the Kingdom has used mediation to successfully further its twin objectives of ensuring and furthering state and regime security, while also playing a central coordinating role in regional affairs. As such, Saudi Arabia is likely to continue to play a similar mediatory role in the foreseeable future. © 2012.",

    "abstract": "This essay explores the impact of DNA fingerprinting on the Islamic law of paternity, with a particular focus on paternity negation and the continued validity of li'an (mutual oaths of condemnation). After surveying the scriptural and legal foundations of li'an in the Islamic legal tradition, the essay traces the introduction of DNA fingerprinting for the resolution of identity and paternity disputes in the modern period, especially in the American legal context. The essay explores the modern Muslim legal opinion on the issue by examining the statements and discussions of three scholarly councils: the Islamic Organization for Medical Sciences, the International Islamic Fiqh Academy, and the Islamic Fiqh Council. The essay argues that the modern Muslim opinion on the issue is a function of both the legal characterization of DNA fingerprinting vis-a-vis shariah methods for the establishment and negation of paternity, and the reconstructed role and objective of li'an as a legal method.

    "abstract": "This paper develops and illustrates a novel theoretical explanation for maximal revisionist challenges to the status quo. I argue that some rising great powers become dissatisfied with the normative and constitutive structure of the status quo and therefore incapable of or unwilling to orient themselves toward reassurance, not because of increasing capabilities but rather due to the domestic political effects produced by perceptions of status immobility-the idea that the status quo is unable to accommodate the rising state's claims to increased status and prestige. I illustrate the argument by showing that Japan's increasing revisionism after 1931 can in large part be explained by widespread perceptions of status immobility linked to Japanese understandings of the role of race in the maintenance of the Western-dominated status hierarchy. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

    "abstract": "Framed in a discussion of post-colonial approaches to the British Empire's influence on culture, a close reading of Captain Donald Campbell's late eighteenth-century travelogue contextualises the personal particularities in his assessments of Habsburg Europe, Ottoman West Asia and Mysorean/British South Asia. His is an imagination in which the bonds of religion ameliorate the otherness of continental Europeans, while his concept of enlightenment learning is deployed to understand the Ottomans. Only in the case of South Asia is the very humanity of the other denied. I argue that this landscape of otherness reflects the coincidence of the interests of his self and the Empire, which overlap most thoroughly in South Asia. Campbell's travelogue is of value to post-colonial approaches, as it is a particularly poignant example of the manner in which the particularities of the self contribute to the construction of broader cultural discourses permeated by Empire. © 2013 South Asian Studies Association of Australia.",

    "abstract": "Much of the recent literature on the evolution of political Islam in the Middle East and North Africa has debated the extent to which Islamist political parties have become “secularized” in their political goals and rhetoric. In these studies, a comparison between the political secularization of Islamism and Christian Democracy is often alluded to, but rarely explored in depth. The two political religious movements share much in common with regards to their historical encounter with political liberalism and their intuitions about an ideal religious society. An uncritical comparison, however, obscures significant differences in the relationship of either movement to democratic institutions, traditional sources of religious authority, and the religious citizens of their nations. This paper qualifies the historical, institutional, and theological similarities of political Islam and political Catholicism. In doing so, it emphasizes the importance of the legacies of Catholic Christendom and Muslim Dar al-Islam as transnational, pre-Westphalian religious political orders and the idea of religious authority found in either. After articulating these bases of comparison, the paper considers how these religious legacies remain present in the transition to Christian or Muslim Democracies by exploring the rhetoric of Catholic civilization or Muslim civilization found in Pope Pius XII and Rachid Ghannouchi’s discourses on democracy.",

Through comparison of the elections using a set of predetermined analytical criteria, the article aims to evaluate the way the Arab Spring has influenced the various electoral processes in these three countries and to assess the role given to elections under authoritarian regimes. Notwithstanding some differences, the three processes showed similar limitations: lack of power attributed to elected institutions; limitations on independent candidatures; low participation rates; and failure of the political empowerment of women. Although the three countries were not immune to the Arab Spring, they managed to contain the effects through redistributive, repressive, and electoral mechanisms. The latter served also as a limited re-legitimizing movement by the regimes in the face of their own citizens following the regional protests. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, platforms for contributing to the international dialogue on migration have multiplied at the regional and inter-regional levels. These efforts underlie the now common understanding that migration is a transnational phenomenon which impacts countries of origin, transit, and destination, and that balancing divergent national interests along with the needs and rights of migrants themselves is essential for ensuring beneficial development outcomes for all. Embedded in a common understanding that migration and development are inexorably linked, and underscoring the need for the economic, social, and human rights of migrants to be safeguarded, regional consultative platforms allow for improved dialogue and cooperation amongst nations that face similar challenges around migration. In addition to enhancing the exchange of experiences and improving policy coordination, such efforts also play an important role by diffusing regional perspectives into the broader, global migration agenda. This paper is intended to contribute to the ongoing debate on regional cooperation and policy harmonization on labor migration to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The first section of this paper briefly reviews the general trends in migration to the region, highlighting the fact that the GCC demonstrates the highest density of migrants to nationals seen anywhere in the world. In the second and third sections the primary structural features of regional labor migration are discussed, in particular the impact of kafala arrangements and the transnational labor brokerage system that brings workers to the Gulf.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of petroleum wealth in the middle of the last century completely reconfigured the political economy of Qatar. Small local population size and low levels of labor force participation pushed Qatar to seek alternate sources of labor to meet burgeoning labor demands. From the 1960s onwards, foreign workers were therefore increasingly brought in to address regional labor shortages. Today, 93 per cent of the total labor force is comprised of non-Qataris. What institutional solutions have been developed to respond to this process? What measures have been put in place to organise the arrival and activity of a large number of workers? Is the “kafeel” system a good one and does it respond to the emerging challenges posed by the inflow of workers?",

    "abstract": "This paper examines whether there is a wage premium for public-sector workers in Peninsular Malaysia and whether there is wage discrimination based on gender. Public-and private-sector wages are estimated using individual-level data from 1995 and 2007 while accounting for sectoral choice by men and women. I find that public-sector employees earn a wage premium, independent of their human capital endowments and personal attributes. This wage premium has increased over the twelve-year period. There is little evidence of a gender wage gap in the public sector; a gender wage gap is more evident in the private sector. © 2014 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.",

This state of affairs, that religion claims to remedy, may be deemed to result from a sense of radical 'otherness' symbolized, in the Abrahamic traditions, by the loss of the blissful unity and proximity of terrestrial paradise. In this paper we propose to show that the Islamic concept of ridā, particularly as it has been conceptualized and practiced in Sufism, is none other than both the means and the end of this re-connection with God and human beings as acceptance of 'otherness.' The Quranic idea of Divine ridwān provides both the transcendent model and the infinite counterpart of this human virtue of acceptance.",

    "abstract": "While recent catastrophic events in New Orleans and Haiti may have magnified issues of social inequity, leaders have debated over poverty and discrimination for decades. Are the poor disadvantaged by the institutions of society or by the choices they make? Through two insightful volumes, the author examines differing academic and political perspectives to help shed light on the causes of poverty and inequality; the role that gender, race, age, or sexual preference plays in determining opportunity; and the effectiveness of current social and economic policies in balancing the inequity among disparate groups. The Economics of Inequality, Poverty, and Discrimination in the 21st Century consists of 2 volumes containing 32 papers divided into 5 categories: measurement, inequality and mobility, institutions and choices, demographic groups and discrimination, and policy. The papers—written by economists, sociologists, philosophers and lawyers—deal with the extent of inequality in the United States and how it compares to other countries, and the newly emerging evidence on the relationship between inequality and mobility within a society.",

    "abstract": "Islamic religious norms are important for Islamic bioethical deliberations. In Muslim societies religious and cultural norms are sometimes confused but only the former are considered inviolable. I argue that respect for Islamic religious norms is essential for the legitimacy of bioethical standards in the Muslim context. I attribute the legitimating power of these norms, in addition to their purely religious and spiritual underpinnings, to their moral, legal, and communal dimensions. Although diversity within the Islamic ethical tradition defies any reductionist or essentialist reconstruction, legitimacy is secured mainly by approximation of Islamic ethical ideals believed to be inherent in the scriptural texts, rather than by the adoption of particular dogmatic or creedal views. With these characteristics, Islamic (bio) ethics may provide useful insights for comparative ethics and global bioethics. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a summary of the results of a one-year student-faculty research project on environmental sustainability in Qatar’s prime knowledge economy vehicle, the Qatar Foundation (QF), and its home, Education City (EC), in Doha. The project’s main objective was to produce new information on the emergence of environmental sustainability policy and practice on the QF’s agenda from a number of angles. The research team adopted a multi-level, multi-method approach to the topic, analyzing developments on three hierarchically interlinked levels: (i) strategic priorities of the State of Qatar and QF; (ii) initiatives and projects in EC; and (iii) individual attitudes and self-reported behavior of EC undergraduate students. A variety of research methods were employed, including documentbased analysis, semi-structured interviews and survey research. The survey, administered in November 2012-February 2013, yielded a sample of 114 responses. Highlights of the survey analysis are presented in this summary paper. The study is believed to have been the first comprehensive look at the evolution of QF’s ambitious agenda to investigate, implement and promote environmental sustainability in EC. In addition to understanding the rationale underpinning the QF’s commitment, the study also explored how the QF’s goals are implemented by QF divisions and university administrations. Also, how EC’s different sustainability programs are understood and received by its core constituency, the students. QF’s commitment to environmental sustainability is both a key contributor to Qatar’s national development and a significant component of its global brand. Therefore, understanding the achievements and challenges in translating ideals of environmental sustainability into practice in EC not only provides a useful basis upon which programs and initiatives may be strengthened and expanded, but also offers important lessons for other institutions in the country and the region. The paper concludes with a number of recommendations, based on the results of the research, relating to improving the effectiveness of sustainability policy in Education City. The project was funded through the Qatar National Research Fund’s Undergraduate Research Experience Program.",

    "abstract": "The advent of the information revolution has been generally heralded as a promising development and a flattening factor,2 providing new opportunities for communication, participation, and deliberation. In the Arab world, however, the effects of the information revolution prior to the Arab Spring were not obvious. Clearly, the changing Arab media ecology brought in new dynamics, expectations, and opportunities. From the ubiquity of pan-Arab satellite television to the ever-expanding Arab blogosphere to the increasing popularity of interactive programs and the rise of social media, Arab audiences have been arguably better informed and more engaged. For some observers, the accessibility of information and the ease of communication have further contributed to the inclusion and politicization of Arab viewers in an authoritarian region.3 For years, the Arab world has been experiencing a disjuncture between the liberal and potentially democratizing impulse of Arab media, on the one hand, and the stagnant political culture and immutable political structures that characterize much of the Middle East, on the other hand. Whence the conundrum: what can possibly be expected from a rejuvenated and dynamic media that emanates from, is sponsored by, thrives within, and serves the interests of inherently authoritarian systems?",

    "abstract": "South Asia has emerged during recent decades as a major theater of tension and conflict around shared rivers. The region is made up of predominantly rural, poor, and agrarian societies. While in recent years India has been showcased as an emerging economic power, the benefits of Indian economic growth have mainly been concentrated in the southern and western areas. Rural populations in eastern India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh continue to have a high concentration of poverty. Persistent agrarian poverty has heightened tension over shared rivers. Concern is also growing among South Asian states that China's quietly but rapidly expanding dam-building activity in the Himalayan region will increase political tensions in South Asia, potentially leading to conflict. This essay explores the myriad sources of water-related tensions between India and Pakistan in the Indus Basin and between India and Nepal and Bangladesh in the Ganges Basin. The essay first reviews the nature and sources of tensions among these South Asian neighbors. It then discusses newly emerging concerns about the potential impact of Chinese activities in Tibet on the lower riparian states in South Asia.",

The project's main objective was to produce new information on the emergence of environmental sustainability policy and practice on the QF's agenda from a number of angles. The research team adopted a multi-level, multi-method approach to the topic, analyzing developments on three hierarchically interlinked levels: (i) strategic priorities of the State of Qatar and QF; (ii) initiatives and projects in EC; and (iii) individual attitudes and self-reported behavior of EC undergraduate students. A variety of research methods were employed, including document-based analysis, semi-structured interviews and survey research. The survey, administered in November 2012-February 2013, yielded a sample of 114 responses. Highlights of the survey analysis are presented in this summary paper. The study is believed to have been the first comprehensive look at the evolution of QF's ambitious agenda to investigate, implement and promote environmental sustainability in EC. In addition to understanding the rationale underpinning the QF's commitment, the study also explored how the QF's goals are implemented by QF divisions and university administrations. Also, how EC's different sustainability programs are understood and received by its core constituency, the students. QF's commitment to environmental sustainability is both a key contributor to Qatar's national development and a significant component of its global brand. Therefore, understanding the achievements and challenges in translating ideals of environmental sustainability into practice in EC not only provides a useful basis upon which programs and initiatives may be strengthened and expanded, but also offers important lessons for other institutions in the country and the region. The paper concludes with a number of recommendations, based on the results of the research, relating to improving the effectiveness of sustainability policy in Education City. The project was funded through the Qatar National Research Fund's Undergraduate Research Experience Program.",

    "abstract": "Mehdi Charef's film Bent Keltoum, released in 2001, uses a triple temporality. First, the longue durée revealing the majesty of the Atlas mountains. It is the time pertaining to the desert, seemingly forever closed unto itself. Then, the temporality of three generations of Berber peoples who live in this desolate area and have adopted its harshness and noble beauty. Thirdly, a short-lived temporality spanning the Algerian civil war in the 90's, when violence, exactions and multiple atrocities were perpetrated against the people of these deprived regions and women in particular. Against this background, the destinies of three women and an old man are depicted. These women navigate and travel literally between these temporalities. They remind us how, despite an oppressive environment, they are able to reach a relative serenity. Travel, nostalgia and the impossibility of ever finding a stable identity are the structuring themes in a film whose beauty remains fascinating.",

    "abstract": "In the twenty-first century, no one can ignore the complex paradigms connected with the precarious relationship between Christians and Muslims all over the globe. Since the seventh century, Christians and Muslims have interacted with one another in a variety of ways. This relationship is sated with both meaningful engagements and baffling ambiguities, running the gamut of constructive dialogue, lethargic encounters, open conflicts, and internecine violence. Nowhere is the need for interreligious cooperation, dialogue, and understanding more pressing than in the Christian and Muslim communities, which constitute approximately 60 percent of the world's population. Fractured Spectrum: Perspectives on Christian-Muslim Encounters in Nigeria deals with an important African dimension in Christian-Muslim relations. Nigeria, with its equal populations of Christians and Muslims, provides an auspicious case study for understanding the cultural, social, theological, economic, and political issues involved in Christian-Muslim encounters. The essays in this book, written by Christian and Muslim scholars who are actively engaged with the Nigerian context, examine some of the issues germane to Christian-Muslim relations in Nigeria. © 2013 Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., New York.

    "abstract": "Contemporary Arab grammarians are in agreement that verbs known as kāna and its sisters are considered to be āl nāqisa 'incomplete verbs,' because they do not indicate all elements of af āl tāmma 'complete verbs.' Verbs inherently indicate an action occurring at a specific time, and therefore the lack of one of these elements renders the verb 'incomplete.' Kāna and its sisters are verbs that indicate a change in time or state, and thus they lack the notion of 'action' that is fundamental in regular verbs. How and when did these concepts emerge? When did the terms 'complete' and 'incomplete' verbs appear in the history of Arabic grammatical theory? This chapter investigates the chronological development of these concepts through an analysis of early Arabic grammatical literature. It examines early Arabic grammarians' awareness, or lack thereof, of these notions; how they presented these verbs in their writings; and how they accounted for this difference.",

The two sides have shown an increasing propensity to negotiate agreements that are slowly, steadily, and very likely permanently, draining the dispute of its traditionally intractable character. Although the Kashmir dispute is yet far from a resolution in the formal sense, it has already lost most of its centrality in India-Pakistan relations. For all intents and purposes, it has arrived at a de facto settlement.",

    "abstract": "This first micro-level study of temporary migrants from developing countries in Qatar uses data collected during the summer of 2007. The median migrant has the following profile: male, thirty-one years of age, single and possessing a high school education. He works ten hours a day, six days per week, and earns US$3,945 per annum of which over half is remitted home to his parents. He incurred a job placement fee equivalent to 1.25 times his monthly salary. Using multivariate regression, we find that migrants' capacity for work is positively correlated with age, having a university degree, and satisfaction with sleep and mental wellbeing. Estimates of a remittance function show that males send more money home, and that migrants are motivated to save, therefore a tendency to transfer higher amounts. We also find that older migrants remit more, suggesting that as the likelihood of returning home increases with age, remittance level rises. © 2012, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "abstract": "Recent defenders of the divine command theory like Adams and Alston have confronted the Euthyphro dilemma by arguing that although God's commands make right actions right, God is morally perfect and hence would never issue unjust or immoral commandments. On their view, God's nature is the standard of moral goodness, and God's commands are the source of all obligation. I argue that this view of divine goodness fails because it strips God's nature of any features that would make His goodness intelligible. An adequate solution to the Euthyphro dilemma may require that God be constrained by a standard of goodness that is external to Himself - itself a problematic proposal for many theists. © 2012, European Journal for Philosophy of Religion.",

    "abstract": "Lebanon’s educational system has been marked by a bifurcation into a network of state-sponsored institutions and a mosaic of private confessional schools. It is often held that the latter are prone to entrench and further fortify communal cocoons and class hierarchies, which impede the formation of a civic national identity. As such, Lebanon’s difficulties in transcending sectarian identities should not be viewed as symptomatic of this unusually pluralistic nation. Rather, the attempts to promote national unity via the establishment of a public schooling system deserve proper contextualization as this project was part and parcel of the agenda of a host of Western and Middle Eastern states since the 19th century. This chapter places these historical reform efforts in Lebanon and the Middle East in their proper global context.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes Qatar’s present and future challenges relating to natural resources and environmental sustainability through the concept of “natural sustainability,” which is defined as the use of natural resources in a way that ensures prosperity for humans and the environment, presently and in the future. By doing so, it proposes an alternative standpoint on sustainable development. The paper asks three broad questions: How is the relationship between development, economy, and the environment understood by different actors in Qatar? What implications do these different views have for planning and definition of desired outcomes in the areas of natural resource use and environmental sustainability? What can a more environment-centered focus contribute toward solving the existing unsustainabilities of development in Qatar and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)? By refocusing attention from the economy and growth to the environment and its limits; and from technology and efficiency to institutions, people, and resourcefulness, Qatar and the GCC states might be able to avoid an impending collapse stemming from their fast exacerbating natural unsustainability.",

    "abstract": "Surging domestic energy consumption in the Gulf region is increasingly threatening oil and gas export revenues. The United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are initiating multiple experiments to improve energy efficiency and introduce renewable energy, prompting the emergence of new domestic actors. Still, the legacy of rentierism hinders many of these efforts. The former antagonistic stance of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states in the international climate regime is being replaced by cautious signals of a more constructive engagement, such as in the willingness of Qatar to host COP 18. The resulting opportunities for constructive and innovative dialogues should not be wasted, and premature statements from Northern governments predicting a failure for COP 18 might be counterproductive. Climate diplomacy should instead try to strengthen the position of those groups in favour of new domestic energy policies. Technical support for Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) pilot projects in the GCC by the EU and other progressive countries in the climate regime could serve as a catalyst for creating sustained synergies between new energy and climate policies in the region.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of DNA paternity tests has stirred a debate concerning the definition of paternity and whether the grounds for such a definition are legal or biological. According to the classical rules of Islamic law, paternity is established and negated on the basis of a valid marriage. Modern biomedical technology raises the question of whether paternity tests can be the sole basis for paternity, even independently of marriage. Although on the surface this technology seems to challenge the authority of Islamic law in this area, the paper argues that classical Islamic rulings pertaining to paternity issues continue to hold higher authority even in cases of conflict with modern technology-based alternatives. Through closer analysis, the paper traces the emergence of a differentiation in the function of DNA tests between identity and paternity verification. While the former is accepted without reservation, the latter is approved only when it does not violate the rulings of Islamic law. © 2012 by the Joint Publication Board of Zygon.",

    "abstract": "One of the most salient aspects of Ayatollah Khomeini's thoughts and revolutionary discourse was his view of the West. Within the context that he articulated these ideas, Khomeini's position toward the generic West - gharb - did not represent a radical departure from the standard position of the Iranian left toward what was commonly perceived as a source of neocolonial domination. Similarly, Khomeini did not necessarily offer a starkly unique interpretation of what position the West occupied in relation to Iran and the rest of the Third World. But Khomeini's position and pronouncements toward the West were undoubtedly one of the most central elements - if not the central element - in his revolutionary discourse that catapulted his views to dominance within Iran's revolutionary movement of the late 1970s. In essence, Ayatollah Khomeini was the right person at the right time, who said the right things as a haphazard political movement to oppose the Pahlavi regime began to coalesce into a revolution. That the Ayatollah had from the very beginning been consistent in his stances on a number of fundamental political issues only enhanced his credibility and revolutionary credentials in the eyes of his growing throngs of supporters. As the snowballing revolution smashed away the pillars of the old regime, and Khomeini found himself leading the revolutionary tidal wave both before and especially after the formal collapse of the Pahlavi dynasty, his steadfast opposition to what the West had come to symbolize helped consolidate his revolutionary leadership and command of the faithful. For more than a decade after the revolution of 1979, Khomeini politically operationalized his conceptions of the West; using it to fend off enemies near and far, real and imagined, as they encroached on and sought to undermine his revolutionary project. Until his death on June 3 1989, the West, as both a philosophical concept and an actual entity which interacted with Iran, remained elemental to the Ayatollah's thoughts, discourse and politics. © Cambridge University Press 2014.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates an intriguing relationship between the demand for telecommunication and remittance services by migrants in Qatar. The hypothesis is that there are important synergies between telecommunications and remittances. Migrants with greater telecom access may have higher demand for remittances, because more frequent communication with relatives raises altruistic motivations for remitting. Migrants who remit more may also demand greater telecommunication service if they seek to monitor remittance recipients' expenditure patterns. Suggestive evidence of complementarities in telecommunication and remittance demand is found using a cross-sectional dataset of temporary migrants in Qatar from developing countries. This finding highlights an overlooked, yet potentially important role of telecommunication in stimulating greater remittances. Copyright © 2012 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "The advent of civil society in the Arab world, the proliferation of nongovernmental advocacy organizations, and the expansion of civil society activism have been heralded as promising developments with significant implications on the region's immutable political environment. While noting the vibrancy of civil society, Zayani's article questions its ability to affect the existing political culture of the region. It argues that the proclivity of civil society activism and associational life to generate political change in the Middle East and North Africa is limited. This is so not so much because the Middle East does not have a strong tradition for supporting civil society or because the concept of civil society is anathema to the region, but because the development of an effective civil society is contingent on a set of political realities, social dispositions, and economic conditions that are missing in the Arab world. In spite of the increasing popularity of civil society activism founded on religious beliefs and the West's vigorous promotion of associational life as a policy tool to induce political change, the social, political, and legal conditions for a potentially consequential civil society are not fully developed. © 2012 by Duke University Press.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to evaluate the political economy of the Gulf Monetary Union (GMU). From a political perspective, I argue that if established, the GMU will increase bargaining power at the supranational level, but it will also raise tensions between and within members states. From an economics perspective, the Union will have a positive, yet limited, impact through an increase in intra‐ industry trade among members. Where the GMU process can have the biggest impact is in improving economic efficiency and enhancing the quality of institutions. A successful monetary union requires discipline, transparency, accountability, institutional independence, coordination, communication, sharing, expanded research capacities and improved statistical frameworks. If the process towards establishing the GMU encourages the candidates to expedite their work towards meeting these requirements, then the countries, through a strengthening in the quality of their institutions, will achieve long‐ term growth, low inflation, and macroeconomic stability. Most importantly, these benefits will come with or without the GMU being established at the end. ",

    "abstract": "Mohamed Zayani The rapid and substantial development of Arab media in the past few years has attracted increased research interest, turning what was a small and in many ways marginalised area of study into a burgeoning field. This relatively new field, however, remains unevenly developed, partly because of the fragmentation of the subject of analysis and partly because of the lack of adequate theoretical frameworks to examine the emerging dynamics and thought processes around the intricacies and implications of the changes engendered. Particularly challenging is the weight of disciplinarity, which often delineates the field of study in narrow communication terms. A media-centric approach is likely to undermine the fact that media speaks of wider processes at work. In a richly complex region like the Middle East, the tight connection between media, political communication, political economy and, in fact, culture at large has not been sufficiently emphasised.

Driving the Saudi media hegemony is what may be loosely termed 'a security imperative' which is tightly connected to internal dynamics, geopolitical considerations and regional rivalries. Empowered with its oil wealth, Saudi Arabia pursued a dual media strategy, operating state-controlled and circumscribed domestic media systems which insulate the population from undesired external influences and uphold the religious sensibility of the kingdom while developing decentralized, open and modern transnational media systems abroad capable of safeguarding the kingdom's interests and promoting its foreign policy. Instrumental as it may be in the kingdom's comprehensive security approach, though, the media have proven to be an inordinately complex asset. Although remarkable in many respects, the liberalization of Saudi media engendered a number of conflictual dynamics which are potentially consequential. © 2012 British Society of Middle Eastern Studies.",

Key variables in the analysis are the years of schooling attained by the best-educated member of each household, an index of labor market activity at the commune level, and the interaction between the two. As schooling is likely to be endogenous, average educational attainment of others in the same age, gender, and commune cohort was used as an instrumental variable (IV). The estimated impact of educational attainment on rpce is economically substantial, statistically significant, increasing over time, and is powerfully enhanced by increasing labor market activity. © SAGE Publications 2012.",

    "abstract": "At the heart of this book is whether oil- and natural gas-dependent rentier monarchies can keep their natural resource use and the environment in balance. By examining the cases of Abu Dhabi and Qatar, it argues that the Gulf monarchies have already reached their limits of “natural sustainability”. As a result of their booming economies, the Gulf Cooperation Council states’ surging electricity and water demand have exerted unexpected pressures on domestic energy supply. Several of them are now dependent on natural gas imports. Groundwater resources are dwindling, food import dependence is high and rising, and the environmental impacts of the past decade’s economic growth are undeniable. Qatar’s per capita emissions of carbon dioxide, for example, are ten times the global average. Simultaneously, the consolidation of climate change on the international agenda has created a new uncertainty for local rulers whose survival is largely underpinned by a ruling bargain that is sustained by export revenues from fossil fuels. Domestic natural resource consumption, together with climate change, are putting unprecedented pressure on the region. Not only is the fragile desert environment of the Gulf under stress, but so too are its states’ power, wealth and stability. This book reveals how Abu Dhabi, the leading emirate of the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar have responded to these new natural resource-related pressures, particularly climate change, and how their responses are inextricably linked with elite legitimacy strategies and the “natural unsustainability” of their political economies.",

    "abstract": "In some Persian Gulf countries, expatriate workers make up as much as eighty-five to ninety percent of the population. Unsurprisingly, these states spend vast amounts of political energy managing their migrant laborers and the social, cultural, and economic changes they bring. Yet, despite this pervasive and far-reaching phenomenon, no comprehensive and easily accessible study of labor migration in the Persian Gulf currently exists. This book ends that oversight by examining the multiple causes, processes, and consequences of labor migration in this region from the disciplinary perspectives of sociology, anthropology, political science, and economics. It critically analyzes the effects of migration on native communities through original and empirically grounded research, identifying the types and functions of formal and informal binational and multinational networks emerging from and sustaining migration patterns. The authors also explore the role of recruitment agencies, as well as look at the values and behaviors of migrant workers both before and after they set off for the Persian Gulf.",

According to Harold Turner, spiritual power is the inspiration by the Holy Spirit through spiritual power over spiritual enemies. The ordinary Pentecostal in Africa is less concerned with modernization and globalization and more about a renewed relationship with God, intimacy with the transcendental empowerment by the Holy Spirit, and protection by the power in the blood of Jesus as the person struggles to eke out a viable life in a hostile environment.24 This perspective is a bold affirmation that prayer is a personal or collective communication with God who is the source of hope, authentic living, and liberation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In engaging with heterogeneous societies, states have oscillated between three modes of dealing with social diversity: accommodation, segregation and eradication. Accordingly, this article cross-examines three typologies of secularism: Consociational secularism (Lebanon), communal partition (India and Pakistan) and coercive secularization (China and Turkey). The article argues that while each state shared the challenge of establishing state sovereignty in pluralistic societies, the central authorities' attempt to impose homogenization varied according to the strength of state institutions, the hold of communal ideologies and the degree of disparate socio-economic interests. The legitimacy of regimes hinged on the perceived impartiality of the state in meeting the demands of diverse socio-economic and ethno-religious constituencies. The article argues that the potential for fragmentation was particularly high when socio-economic fault-lines overlapped with, and reinforced ethno-religious fissures. When sectarian solidarity trumped loyalty to the state, partition along communal lines unfolded within the caldron of civil war, as was the case in Lebanon in 1975 and the Indian Subcontinent in 1947 and 1971. By contrast, the authoritarian states of Maoist China and Kemalist Turkey could enforce, albeit violently and at great human cost, a rigidly secular, cultural homogenization in part because they were perceived to be lessening socio-economic inequalities despite their assault on traditional identities. In all cases, and regardless of whether or not a dominant majority existed or not, sovereignty and state legitimacy was ultimately predicated not so much on the absence or presence of democracy or diversity, but on the provision of a critical measure of justice for all citizens irrespective of origin or identity. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",

    "abstract": "Much of the scholarly debate over Islam and democracy has centered on what has been referred to as the 'inclusion-moderation hypothesis,' and whether democratic institutions are capable of incorporating hostile religious actors. To build on this debate, the concept of inclusion and the expectations about its political effects should be broadened to include the interaction between religion-state relationships and democratization processes in predominantly Muslim societies. Inviting ambivalently democratic religious actors into the public democratic space produces dynamics of both political moderation and religious change. The mechanisms of this theoretical model can be evaluated by tracing the evolution of two Islamist political parties in Algeria, the MSP-Hamas and Ennahda-Islah.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the factors that affect variations in secular attitudes toward politics. The literature suggests that modernization may weaken traditional bonds with religious adherence and the state can assume an important role in this endeavor through mass education, industrialization, and other factors. However, this explanation is incomplete in light of the resurgence of religious movements. This study argues that economic inequality increases the positive evaluation of the role of religion in politics through its effect on religiosity and participation in religious organizations. Employing a multilevel analysis on 40 countries, this study demonstrates that inequality decreases attitudes toward support for two dimensions of public secularization: the secularization of public office holders and the influence of religious leaders in politics. Simultaneously, the effect of modernization on these attitudes varies. The results also suggest that although inequality diminishes secular attitudes of all socioeconomic groups, its effect is nonlinear, with a greater effect on the poor. © The Author(s) 2012.",

CCAs make for a more flexible and meaningful use of revenue than an equal-sized basic income, resource dividend, or stakeholder grant.",

    "abstract": "Comparative politics has undergone significant theoretical changes in recent decades. Particularly since the 1980s, a new generation of scholars have revamped and rejuvinated the study of the subject.Mehran Kamrava examines current and past approaches to the study of comparative politics and proposes a new framework for analysis. This is achieved through a comparative examination of state and social institutions, the interactions that occur between them, and the poltical cultures within which they operate. The book also offers a concise and detailed synthesis of existing comparative frameworks that, up to now at least, have encountered analytical shortcomings on their own.Although analytically different in its arguments and emphasis from the current 'Mainstream' genre of literature on comparative politics, the present study is a logical outgrowth of the scholarly works of the last decade or so. It will be essential reading for all students of comparative politics. © 2008 Mehran Kamrava.",

    "abstract": "The United States might not seem like fertile ground for the basic income guarantee (BIG). It is, after all, the place where “workfare” was born, where “welfare” became a bad word, and where “welfare mothers” became demonized. It might, therefore, be surprising that the world’s first basic income, if only a partial one, was introduced in Alaska in 1982 and has been the most popular programme in the state ever since, continuing to grow in size and in popularity. It might also be surprising that the United States was the first country to have a mainstream national political movement for the basic income guarantee. In the 1970s, the United States came closer than any other industrialized country has so far to introducing a nationwide basic income guarantee, and various incarnations of the proposal continue to be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Vietnam's continuing economic transformation has sharply increased the demand for highly-qualified business graduates. Vietnamese universities have responded to this increase in demand by improving the quality of their programs and raising their performance standards. The degree to which high-quality competitive programs increase students' satisfaction with their educational experience is determined by their psychological hardiness in learning, their learning motivation, and their assessments of the functional value of business education. This study gathered survey data from a convenience sample of 1,024 business students in Vietnam, then validated measures of four constructs: Quality of College Life, psychological hardiness in learning, learning motivation, and perceived functional value of business education. The relationships among the constructs were estimated by Structural Equation Modeling. The results demonstrate that psychological hardiness in learning and learning motivation have statistically significant positive impacts on students' perceived Quality of College Life. The impacts are significantly stronger for students with higher assessments of the functional value of a business education. These findings suggest that universities could enhance the Quality of College Life and academic performance by offering programs to cultivate students' psychological hardiness in learning and their learning motivation, and by providing them with objective information about the functional value of business careers. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

    "abstract": "Change occurs rapidly in the Persian Gulf. While some states have capitalised on the fast-paced nature of globalised fiscal transactions and have become important markets for foreign investment, others have fallen victim to such speculations. The ‘Dubai Model’ of economic diversification is being re-evaluated as the GCC states continue to seek the best means of organizing their economies and competing within the global order. Explaining the different ways in which globalising forces have shaped new dimensions to the political economy of the Persian Gulf states, this book evaluates the changes that have occurred, especially in light of the ongoing global economic crisis. Mutually beneficial rentier arrangements have guided the GCC countries formation of oil-based economies and labor relations in the past, but will this necessarily be the case in the future? This book addresses key issues including discussion on the future demographic aspects of the GCC ; the feasibility of establishing a GCC monetary union; the effects of rentierism on state autonomy; and analysis of sovereign wealth funds and Islamic banking models.",

    "abstract": "This article aims to demonstrate why a handful of countries, most prominently Saudi Arabia, together with Kuwait and Qatar, continue to greatly influence other Middle Eastern Arab states' external climate change policies. The article explores three questions: why do Arab states continue to disregard climate change as a significant instability factor; why do most oil-exporting states of the Arabian Peninsula still oppose ambitious mitigation; and why do their policies continue to determine the positions of other Arab states? In order to answer these questions, the article uses an analytical approach that takes into account both sides of the 'black box'. The article confirms the contention that the constancy of the dominating states' policies stems from the interests of local, status quo-favouring rentier elites. These rentier governments, it is argued, choose to ignore the need to act against the potentially destabilising longer-term consequences of climate change, instead emphasising the safeguarding of short and near-term economic and political stability. In the other Arab states, natural resource scarcities and traditional security problems narrow the scope of attention and resources available for active responses and participation in international climate negotiations. This has led to weak position-formation and a disposition to follow the stronger voices in the region, despite often apparently misaligned interests. However, with the recent rise in regional awareness of the negative physical impacts of climate change, particularly in the area of water security, there is increasing pressure for the resource-scarcer Arab states of the Mashriq (and also Maghrib) to form independent policies. This could potentially further complicate the prospects of a region-wide response to this major transboundary challenge. © 2011, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

At the same time, the Gulf has been wracked by political instability and tension. Together, the essays in this volume present a comprehensive, detailed, and accessible account of the international politics of the region. Focusing on the key factors that give the Persian Gulf its strategic significance, contributors look at the influence of vast deposits of oil and natural gas on international politics, the impact of the competing centers of power of Iran and Saudi Arabia, the nature of relationships among countries within the Persian Gulf, and the evolving interaction between Islam and politics. Throughout the collection, issues of internal and international security are shown to be central.",

    "abstract": "Plantinga famously argues against evidentialism that belief in God can be properly basic. But the epistemology of cognitive faculties such as perception and memory which produce psychologically non-inferential beliefs shows that various inferentially justified theoretical beliefs are epistemically prior to our memory and perceptual beliefs, preventing the latter from being epistemically basic. Plantinga's analogy between the sensus divinitatis and these cognitive faculties suggests that the deliverances of the sensus divinitatis cannot be properly basic either. Objections by and on behalf of Plantinga to this argument are considered. © 2011 The Author The Philosophical Quarterly © 2011 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly.",

    "abstract": "Political development literature held that the process of secularization is conflict-ridden between the state and religious institutions. Later state building literature left state-religion relations outside its theoretical scope and left a puzzle in our understanding of state building. How did state-religion relations really change in the course of modern state formation? This article argues that the relationship between state builders and religious institutions was not necessarily conflictual. Rather, there were potential areas of cooperation between the two. However, whether any cooperation was realized was historically contingent. Depending on the type of relationship established, state-religion relations took different institutional shapes. This article makes two observations. First, if the religious institutions have a fairly hierarchical internal organization, then the state and religious institutions part their ways. This is the picture classical political development literature paints. Second, in cases where the state faces a disunited body of religious institutions, the state incorporates religious institutions into its apparatus, its extent depending on the institutional capacity of the state. As the institutional capacity of the state increased, its control over religious institutions also increased. The article then illustrates these observations through major cases from the Middle East. © Copyright Religion and Politics Section of the American Political Science Association 2010.",

    "abstract": "The essay explores Baudelaire's application of synesthesia as a figure of fusion on the vertical and horizontal planes in order to demonstrate that the figure's extensions develop both spiritual and psychophysical dimensions of his work as literary self-portrait. The integration of different types of synesthesia is shown to contribute to the creation of a total autotelic artwork of which the lyric subject is at once the core and the perimeter. The analysis concerns the self-referential technique of mise en abyme because it installs the self as center even when the subject of the text appears to be an other. The role of rhetoric, symbolism, and the poet's creative imagination are also examined because they incorporate various others including famous artists, philosophers, and aspects of mysterious, faraway lands.

    "abstract": "This book brings together fifty of today's finest thinkers. They were asked to let their imaginations run free to advance new ideas on a wide range of social and political issues. They did so as friends, on the occasion of Philippe Van Parijs's sixtieth birthday. Rather than restricting themselves to comments on his numerous writings, the authors engage with the topics on which he has focused his attention over the years, especially with the various dimensions of justice, its scope, and its demands. They discuss issues ranging from the fair distribution of marriage opportunities to the limits of argumentation in a democracy, the deep roots of inequality, the challenges to basic income and the requirements of linguistic justice. They provide ample food for thought for both academic and general readers.",

    "abstract": "Why has the West developed and modernized, while the Muslim world has lagged behind? Why has democracy not found a hospitable home in much of the Muslim world? Why have the opponents of innovation found their message so resonant with ordinary Muslims? Featuring essays by a multidisciplinary group of leading scholars, this volume offers in-depth analyses of the history, causes, consequences, and obstacles to innovation in Islam. Focusing on the ways and means through which the teachings of Islam have been produced and perpetuated over time, the contributors investigate such areas as the arts and letters, jurisprudence, personal status, hermeneutics and epistemology, and Muslims’ perceptions of the self in the modern world. Innovation in Islam illuminates a debate that extends beyond semantics into everyday politics and society—and one that has ramifications around the world.",

Drawing on critical theory and recent ethnographic work, the paper is an attempt to refocus the study of Arab media within cultural anthropology. It argues that the study of the evolving Arab mediascape calls not so much for consolidating the field within the purview of the discipline of media and communication, but for a cross-disciplinary, theoretically informed and empirically grounded study of localized practices that is amenable to articulating overlapping dynamics of correspondences and disjunctions set in motion by mass-mediated everyday life processes. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",

    "abstract": "Excavating Gender Justice: The Predicament and the Promise disentangles discourses and practices of asymmetrical power. It engages culture and politics by expounding the ways in which religion, modernity, tradition, jurisprudence, and citizenship have come to comprise constitutive elements of gender politics. When we speak of gender justice, we confront matters that lie at the heart of the knottiest philosophical, legal, and anthropological conundrums. These issues have prompted many to grapple with definitions and typologies derived from fields of inquiry as diverse as neoliberal economics, multiculturalism, constitutionalism, democratic political theory, and development. Excavating Gender Justice provides neither a typology nor a definitive definition of its subject. Others have assumed the task before. For example, Anne Marie Goetz (2007) explained the link between gender justice and debates on citizenship, entitlements, rights, and law and development by delineating three mutually inclusive perspectives: a) gender justice as entitlements and choice, the enabling paradigm; b) gender justice as absence of discrimination; and c) gender justice as positive rights. © 2011 Brill.",

    "abstract": "This essay argues that the ubiquity of digital media for representations of sexuality is rivaled only by the fact that any positive outcome for such media is largely ignored in both popular and scholarly imaginations about it. The essay examines John Cameron Mitchell's 2006 Shortbus, a film noted for the explicitness of its sexual representations, against the terms of its digital supplements in order to suggest that the sex life of the digital does not exist but as an array of demonized forms. That is, digital sexualities and the erotic affinities afforded by the technological innovations of the past twenty years - such as anonymity, decorporalization, self-invention and reinvention, randomness - are largely disregarded by older 'dominant' media forms and their subtending industries. Thus, few such mediations (including cinema, television, and print media) seek to account for the sexualities of the digital in nonpathologized ways. Simultaneously, sexual subjects go about their business of putting digital mediations to uses largely undisclosed to all but themselves, and in light of this, the essay examines three digital technologies that appear in Shortbus as being unnarratable: though they appear as ordinary elements of the diegesis, the digital camera, the Internet, and the cellular smartphone each allow the film's queer male figures to exceed the generic constraints of the film in its customary dimensions and to see where digital sexualities - the visual iconography of digital photography, the pleasures of Internet pornography, and the sexual networks of the cellular - part ways with the cinematic.

The paper highlights several interconnected leverage points: media content, practices, processes, ownership, education, structures, and policies. It argues that fostering cultural diversity in and through the media can go a long way toward bringing a civic discourse which favors tolerance and facilitates co-existence. It can contribute to the breaking down of cultural barriers, the initiation of cultural dialogues, the empowerment of marginalized groups, and the practice of good governance. At the same time, this paper argues, the celebration of difference does not preclude the valuation of a common cultural core or a common humanity which brings people together in spite of their differences.",

    "abstract": "In the wake of increasingly globalized trade initiatives and the proliferation of digital technologies, the issue of copyright infringement has become a subject of keen media attention and a topic of enthusiastic public debate. Through a variety of corporate- and government-sponsored anti-piracy campaigns, copyright infringement is conceptually framed as a 'piracy' that is in need of urgent combat. This study analyzes how antipiracy media campaigns are as responsible for the propagation of 'piracy' as those partaking in copyright infringement. With the dominant discourse of the 'war on terror' playing out in the background, the anti-piracy discourse is being sounded through an increasingly militarized language that relies on metaphors of war to inspire fear among audiences and to criminalize even the most casual of informational exchanges. Current anti-piracy campaigns discursively frame copyright infringement as a dangerous crime by connecting it to the word 'piracy' and to its cut-throat predecessor, open-sea piracy, to hold back the tide of wide-spread proliferation. © 2011 National Communication Association.",

    "abstract": "The historical solution to the security problem in the Persian/Arabian Gulf, that is, the active military protection of a super power, is no longer sustainable as the unipolar world gives way to a multipolar one and the credibility of the United States to provide military security is being increasingly questioned. This paper addresses a question neglected by both international and regional analysts: can Turkey play any role in the future Gulf security architecture? The paper argues that Turkey can help the GCC states develop effective state institutions and build regional institutional mechanisms to solve potential crises and alleviate the security dilemma in the Gulf. It can deliver this public good to the region precisely because Turkey has strong economic and political interests to have good relations with all sides concerned with the Gulf security.",

    "abstract": "Qatar presents an interesting case study on the nature of state-religion relations as despite being of the same Wahhabi and Hanbali branch as neighboring Saudi Arabia, there are stark differences in the role of religion at a political level within the two countries. The main reason for such differences will be shown through field research to be the lack of an indigenous Ulama class within Qatar. Among other things Baskan and Wright argues that at a political level, Qatar has a secular character more comparable to Turkey than Saudi Arabia.",

    "abstract": "Stipulations within the formal protocols of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) established free movement of nationals as an essential component of the region's movement towards full economic integration. This paper analyzes the protocols within the broader construct that stresses human emancipation and freedom of mobility as fundamental human rights. Throughout the GCC, states face the peculiar dilemma of supporting full freedom of mobility for citizens while also severely limiting and curtailing the mobility of the dominant, non-national population. This paper questions how normative debates on the freedom of movement apply to the Gulf region and examines the policy and practice of strictly managing the movement of international migrants while at the same time freeing up movement for citizenry. This paper proposes that in the GCC, the regional political economy and the processes of regionalization and globalization have combined to tighten controls over mobility and migration.",

    "abstract": "This chapter examines the impact of African cultural traditions on interpretations of human rights. It finds considerable tension between a Western-defined notion of universal human rights and the ways in which rights are understood within particular local contexts. It also observes how the intersection of globalization and local traditions is producing emergent and unexpected ways of thinking about rights. It suggests that religion is especially important not only because of its historic role in sub-Saharan Africa or the challenges it experienced during colonialism, but also because of the rapid growth in many areas of Islam and Pentecostal Christianity. Drawing on the work of Anthony Giddens, it is argued in this chapter that the changes taking place amid globalization represent a kind of 'disembedding' of local traditions that yields new understandings of rights and how to secure them. The chapter focuses on controversies surrounding women's rights and female genital mutilation (FGM) illustrates how different African societies have responded to this dynamic. © Oxford University Press, 2013.

    "abstract": "Uniquely for a country its size, Qatar has emerged as one of the world's most proactive mediators in recent years. Motivated by a combination of international prestige and survival strategies, the country has sought to position itself as a neutral peacemaker in many of the international and intra-national conflicts brewing across the Middle East region. In three of the most notable cases in which it has involved itself - Lebanon, Sudan, and Yemen - Qatar has proven itself to be a capable mediator in reducing tensions but not, crucially, in resolving conflicts. Qatar's successes have been facilitated by a combination of its perceived neutrality by the disputants, the vast financial resources at its disposal to host mediation talks and offer financial incentives for peace, and the personal commitment and involvement of the state's top leaders. These successes, however, are often checked by limited capabilities to affect long-term changes to the preferences of the disputants through power projection abilities, in-depth administrative and on-the-ground resources, and apparent underestimations of the complexities of the deep-rooted conflicts at hand. Qatari mediation efforts are likely to continue in the foreseeable future, but their outcomes are also likely to remain mixed. © Middle East Institute.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, tens of thousands of migrant domestic workers in Kuwait have developed new-found 'Islamic piety'.1 Occurring in a much maligned and understudied region-the Arabian Peninsula-this widespread phenomenon has either been elided, cynically dismissed or the motivations for these conversions and their sociohistorical conditions of possibility assumed. Domestic workers' own articulations focus on 'house talk' and suggest a shift in analytic focus, with an emphasis on everyday relationships and activities within households as generative of their new-found Islamic piety. Domestic workers experience becoming Muslim not as a radical break from their previous relationships and religious practices, but as a gradual reworking of them. The domestic workers' expression of their new-found Islamic faith points to the household as a space of confluence between Islamic ethical practice and the affective and immaterial labour entailed by domestic work, as well as between global Islam and the feminisation of transnational labour migration that marks our contemporary world. © 2010 The Australian National University.",

    "abstract": "Religious and literary texts provide the most useful information for studying the life of women at the time Islam was founded as a religion and civilization, roughly the sixth to ninth centuries C.E. Because of the scarcity of sources, the concrete realities of women's lives during this early period of Islamic history have yet to be fully studied, which is one reason for the often contradictory conclusions scholars reach regarding the impact of Islam on women and gender. The debate concerning women and Islam is itself quite modern, arising from colonialism and the efforts of modernizing governments under Western tutelage to introduce the modernity they embraced as nation-state culture and ideology. Was the resistance to modernity by Muslim societies due to Islam? Was it Islam that dictated the patriarchal order under which Muslim women lived? What particular issues and laws hindered the progress of Muslim women, and is the answer to be found in secular laws and human rights?",

Since this essay is a tribute to Ina Beasley, it reproduces substantial excerpts from her papers on the subjects that engaged her most deeply during her Sudan service. Her writings shed new light on the social history of human rights during the Condominium, which matters both to scholars and to concerned citizens. In recognition of Ina Beasley, who devoted her life to improving the lives of women and children in a society rife with hardship and discriminatory practices, the essay addresses her work on education and its relevance to eradicating female circumcision that was universally practiced at the time. The essay begins with a brief discussion of Sudanese politics at the time of her arrival and then examines her work as educator who managed to craft several influential programs to empower women and girls. The rest of the paper focuses on her reproductive health advocacy as exemplified in a formidable body of work that articulated her activities and approaches to social rights. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2011.",

Pathways to an Inner Islam provides an introduction to the esoteric or spiritual inner Islam presented by Western thinkers Louis Massignon, Henry Corbin, Ren Gunon, and Frithjof Schuon. Particularly interested in Sufism the mystical tradition of Islam these four twentieth-century authors who wrote in French played an important role in presenting Islamic spirituality to the West and have also had an influence in parts of the Muslim world, such as Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. Patrick Laude brings them together to argue that an understanding of their inner Islam challenges reductionist views of Islam as an essentially legalistic tradition and highlights its spiritual qualities. The book discusses their thought on the definitions of spiritual Islam and Sufism, the metaphysical and mystical understanding of the Prophet and the Qur. © 2010 State University of New York.

    "abstract": "The separatist movement in the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has its roots in the 1947 partitioning of British India into the two successor states of India and Pakistan. As independence neared, the British drew up a partition plan providing only two options to the hundreds of quasi-autonomous princely states dotting the sub-continent at the time — accession either to India or Pakistan. However, the Hindu ruler of Muslim-majority J&K at that time, Maharaja Hari Singh, favoured neither of those options and, instead, clung to the ill-fated hope of retaining the shred of independence awarded only in principle to all the princely states at the moment when British paramountcy lapsed in August 1947. Indians and Pakistanis disagree fundamentally about what happened next. But the issue of J&K’s de facto accession to one or the other side was ultimately settled, in any event, not by the maharaja but on the ground in the course of the first war between India and Pakistan (1947-9). That war ended indecisively, with the state divided into two parts by a heavily fortified ceasefire line (CFL). Divided it has remained ever since, cited endlessly and fruitlessly as the unsettled ‘core issue’ in India—Pakistan relations. Over more than six decades, this issue has been battered and substantially reshaped by numerous regional storms — including Pakistan’s defeat and breakup in the 1971 Bangladesh war, the acquisition by India and Pakistan of nuclear weapons, the surfacing of a prolonged and bloody Kashmiri separatist insurgency in the final decade of the twentieth century, and, at the start of the twentyfirst century, the onset of the global war on terrorism.",

    "abstract": "The modern system of sovereign states that was ushered in by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 has had as one of its central tenets the territorial integrity of states. There is irony in the fact, therefore, that another of its central tenets, acquired in more recent centuries, has attached equal importance to the requirement of correspondence between the territorial state and the nation. Since the nation has typically been understood in terms of a people’s cultural or ethnic (most often including linguistic) identity, a feature of human society stubbornly defiant both of unambiguous definition and of distinct boundaries, determining the right match between the state and the ethnically defined nation has proven to be one of the most stubbornly perplexing and perilous conundrums of the modern era. The difficulty in gaining widespread assent to any particular match has meant endless challenges to the legitimacy of existing nation-state boundaries. It has also meant the nearly continuous obsolescing of world maps.",

    "abstract": "Dés lors qu'ils se comportent comme des managers, ils doivent nécessairement incorporer les disciplines propres au management: calculer, quantifier, soutirer des profits des projets, plaire au public,25 'savoir abandonner l'autonomie de l'artiste pour une vie plus équilibrée dans laquelle la meritocratic a remplacé l'idéologie du don inné'.26 Le statut précaire d'intermittent étant répandu chez les artistes dés lors qu'ils vivent pour l'art mais pas nécessairement de l'art, il devient donc urgent pour eux de s'engager dans une multitude de projets, d'ailleurs plus ou moins compatibles entre eux, comme le reprochera Clara é Antoine et son ami qui, s 'étant fait commissionner, vont désormais travailler é une grande fresque murale pour embellir l'usine de Castella. 29 Le lieu de neutralité relative est, dans cette nouvelle configuration du champ, le bistrot oé l'on se sent bien, tenu par Manie, é personnage peu conventionnel qui brouille les repéres d'une analyse sociologique simple par ses appartenances sociales multiples, elle qui sert de lien entre le monde de l'art en sa qualité d'amie des artistes et le monde des affaires, en tant que protectrice de Castella et la seule é lui montrer quelque affection et surtout é en comprendre la valeur humaine. Elle partage avec lui ce caract?re nomade, lui sur le mode du garde du corps itin?rant qui voyage de lieu en lieu au gr? des missions qui lui sont confi?es32 par les compagnies d'assurances et elle, par sa grande ouverture d'esprit et la disponibilit? avec laquelle elle entraide et conseille ses habitu?s. Ce bistro tient lieu d'espace qui rassemble et fait interagir des univers sociaux en apparence oppos?s: lieu de discussions sur l'art et le spectacle o? l'?tre et le para?tre des protagonistes est intimement li?, o?, derri?re une fa?ade d'intellectualisme progressif perce une conclusion souvent cynique, ? savoir que le monde de l'art baigne dans la mesquinerie et que les artistes, derri?re une rh?torique soign?e, ne sont certes pas les derniers ? ass?ner des coups bas.33 Ce film tragicomique se termine pourtant sur la note optimiste des artistes composant avec Castella pour r?aliser la fresque, sans animosit? apparente et toute honte bue, le tout accompagn? de la bande sonore du 'Je ne regrette rien',34 prouvant qu'un nouveau d?part est toujours possible ? qui parvient ? d?passer les cadres sociaux contraignants et artificiels et concevoir de nouveaux projets.35 En ce qui concerne notre niveau d'analyse macroéconomique, cela prouverait que le management peut étre aussi une discipline de rationalisation des firmes (dont les entreprises culturelles ne sont pas les moindres aujourd'hui) mais sans que le but de maximisation du profit lui soit nécessairement associé, ou, ce qui revient au méme, que le management peut servir aujourd'hui é des fins artistiques pour peu que l'on ait é faire é de petits patrons 'visionnaires' et que les artistes qui travaillent é parachever leurs vues puissent dépasser leur mépris de classe et leur prétention infondée.36 C'est déjé poser beaucoup de conditions! Dans le film, nous verrons que Castella, le 'n?o-manager' fortun? met un point d'honneur ? se cultiver: il semble qu'il veuille comprendre artistiquement ce qu'il ach?te et ne point passer pour un inculte. 5 II est int?ressant de souligner que Rouen est la ville natale de Flaubert, ville du nord qui, si l'on en croit le film, ne conna?t pas de minorit?s et ne refl?te aucunement toute la diversit? de la population fran?aise. 6 J'entends ici par 'flexibilit?' les nouveaux modes d'organisation du travail mis en place par l'?conomie n?olib?rale depuis le milieu des ann?es 80, qui pr?conisent la mouvance, le changement, le nomadisme. 7 Cette expression de Bourdieu est une des formes de la violence symbolique qui consiste ? culpabiliser ceux qui n'ont pas les go?ts l?gitimes et ? leur inculquer une sorte de honte de soi.",

    "abstract": "Iran's June 2009 elections set into motion four processes that are central to the operations of the Islamic Republic regime. They include: the growing gap between large sections of Iranian society from the Islamic Republican state; the steady militarization of the political system; the unprecedented degree to which the Supreme Leader has become an active partisan in the increasingly bitter political infighting among regime insiders, and-most significantly-the violent disruption of an emerging set of 'rules of the game,' that previously served as a safety check against excessive factional infighting. This last consequence of the election and its aftermath is likely to leave its most enduring imprint on the State. Specifically, the elections have taken Iran from manageable factionalism to the brink of complete political paralysis. As such, given the untenability of the State's present predicament, far-reaching changes are almost certain to come. © 2010.",

    "abstract": "Drawing on recent work in social philosophy and rational choice theory, in this paper I argue that the core thematic of Kant’s “What is Enlightenment?” is the relationship between reason and constraints. I discuss in some detail Kant’s definition of and distinction between private and public uses of reason. Most generally, I maintain that while Kant’s sense of the private use of reason is too narrowly conceived, his cosmopolitan notion of the public use of reason is far too broad. As a more robust alternative, I propose an account of constitutive constraints and characterize more fully what it means for individuals to make reflexive use of reason vis-à-vis such constraints.",

Mimicking worldwide trends, imports from and exports to the Middle East and North Africa dropped significantly in 2009. This sudden decline in global trade should not divert attention away from four major developments in global economic integration that have shaped the region's trade policies and performance over the past decade: the emergence of global supply chains, the growth of trade in services, the rise of China and India as major international trading powers, and regional integration. The first development is the rise of global production networks in which different stages of the production of a single good occur at different locations. As a result of this development, consumer products often contain parts, components, and inputs from a large number of countries. The second major trend relates to trade in services. With the wave of liberalization and of information and communications-related technological developments, off-shoring in services such as back-office work processes, call center operations, medical transcription, accounting, and legal research has boomed.",

The rallies that occurred among Sudanese inside and outside the Sudan following the 2009 indictment of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir by the International Criminal Court (ICC) are particularly revealing. Examining what has been represented worldwide as the first genocide of the twenty-first century brings to light the ideologies that are expressed in impassioned political positions. Ideology, which implicitly undergirds the mixed emotions with which the ICC warrant was received, has been fundamental to the Darfur story from the start of the crisis in 2003. Describing Darfur in three distinct sociopolitical arenas, one sees various scenarios that are akin to a play with multiple actors and scenes, each of which is contextually mediated and expertly produced. The disconnections, ruptures, and shifts in the flow of this narration point to the disparities in the situational, local, regional, and transnational forces at work.",

After examining some of these scriptural passages, we will argue that in light of these texts, the notion of faith is best understood as some type of commitment such as trust, loyalty or piety, rather than as merely a belief in God's existence. After carefully showing the form this theodicy must take, I argue that the testing theodicy suffers from serious difficulties and fails to adequately account for the existence of natural evil. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

    "abstract": "This article argues that, under likely empirical conditions, sufficientarianism leads not to an easily achievable duty to maintain a social minimum but to the onerous duty of maintaining a social maximum at the sufficiency level. This happens because sufficientarians ask us to give no weight at all to small benefits for people above the sufficiency level if the alternative is to relieve the suffering of people below it. If we apply this judgment in a world where there are rare diseases and hard-to-prevent accidents that cause people to fall below the sufficiency threshold, all of our discretionary spending will have to be devoted to bringing harder and harder cases up to sufficiency. Nothing will be left for anyone to consume above the sufficiency level. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2010.",

    "abstract": "Authoritarian elites often prolong their tenure in office by engaging in wholesale institutional change. Whether inherited or created from scratch, state institutions in non-democracies are meant to solidify elite cohesion and political control, pacify potential opponents, and create coalitions that support the state. Nevertheless, autocrats keep a watchful eye on these institutions, and if they change internally in directions that may seem threatening to state leaders, the institutions are changed or even disbanded. Change to the institutions of the non-democratic state is caused by a combination of deliberate decisions and institutional crafting by state leaders on the one hand, and by institutional layering and changes initiated from within the institutions rhemselves on the other. As the cases of the National Assembly in Kuwait, the Revolutionary Command Council in Egypt, and the Revolutionary Council in Iran demonstrate, when and if state institutions become inefficient or are seen as a threat by authoritarian leaders, then state leaders once again take control in determining their shape and configuration. Non-democracies are often preserved through purposive institutional change. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",

    "abstract": "In a sociopolitical and cultural context like that of Sudan, where forces of militarist, Islamist, and traditionalist politics persist with tenacity, chronicling the politics and intellectual legacy of Sudanese Marxism is a must for apprehending both its historiography and its present struggle for institutionalizing societal transformation. 'What's Left of the Left?' is not a mere commemoration of the efforts to enact progressive politics in a society deeply entrenched in sectarian traditionalist loyalties. Instead, it devotes systematic attention to the patterns through which reflexivity and debate helped spawn new and essential dialogues on the cultural politics of the nation-state and national identity. Drawing inspiration from the powerful intellectual vision of the late Abdel Khaliq Mahgoub, 'What's Left of the Left?' elucidates the predominant debates within the Left itself as it worked clandestinely throughout years of the institutionalized state's contraventions of fundamental rights that engulfed the people and marked the country. In so doing, 'What's Left of the Left?' illuminates reflexivity and internal critique in an effort to mount feasible arguments on the promises and predicaments of localizing what conservative Sudanese condemned as imported ideology. However, the Left's relentlessness in tailoring Marxism in a society emerging from the shadows of colonialism necessitated the rise of a charismatic leader such as Mahgoub, whose life was devoted to a desire to make history and to his keen interest in challenging complacency and narrow-minded nationalism, which proved detrimental to the betterment of the lives of Sudanese people, a reality that continues even now, as we witness debates on secession, ethnic cleansing, marginality, and charges of genocide.",

It was in Balochistan,2 the vast and sparsely populated province in southwestern Pakistan, that the Pakistan army had ruthlessly suppressed a tribal separatist insurgency in the course of the 1970s. Rebellious Balochistan lay between Afghanistan and the sea; and since Soviet forces had occupied Afghanistan militarily in late 1979, the possibility that Soviet leaders might be tempted to realize the long-cherished Russian goal of securing a warm-water port by exploiting lingering separatist grievances in neighbouring Pakistan had naturally arisen. ‘A glance at the map’, Harrison wrote at the outset of the book, ‘quickly explains why strategically located Baluchistan and the five million Baluch tribesmen who live there could easily become the focal point of superpower conflict.’3",

    "abstract": "This is the first full-length examination of Lewis H. Hine (1874-1940), the intellectual and aesthetic father of social documentary photography. Kate Sampsell-Willmann assesses Hine's output through the lens of his photographs, his political and philosophical ideologies, and his social and aesthetic commitments to the dignity of labor and workers. Using Hine's images, published articles, and private correspondence, Lewis Hine as Social Critic places the artist within the context of the Progressive Era and its associated movements and periodicals, such as the Works Progress Administration, Tennessee Valley Authority, the Chicago School of Social Work, and Rex Tugwell's American Economic Life and the Means of Its Improvement. This intellectual history, heavily illustrated with HIne's photography, compares his career and concerns with other prominent photographers of the day--Jacob Riis, Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand, Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, and Margaret Bourke-White. Through detailed analysis of how Hine's images and texts intersected with concepts of urban history and social democracy, this volume reestablishes the artist's intellectual preeminence in the development of American photography as socially conscious art.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the frequency of premenstrual symptoms and prevalence of PMS among young Iranian women. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 2005 among female students of Zahedan University (Iran), aged 18-27 years. Overall 300 participants were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire assessing premenstrual symptoms. The items of the questionnaire were derived from DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder and PMS symptoms reported in existing literature. Results: Of the 300 participants, 98.2% reported at least one mild to severe premenstrual symptom and 16% met the criteria of DSM-IV for PMS. Most common symptoms were feeling of tiredness or lethargy (84%), depressed mood (72.3%), sudden feeling of sadness or tearfulness (70.3%), anxiety (70%), backache (69%) and sleep problems (66%). There was no significant difference in severity of symptoms based on marital status and living conditions (living with parents or away from parents), but severity of symptoms were significantly higher for the younger women (18-20 years) compared to the older women (21-24 and 25-27 years). Conclusion: High frequency of premenstrual symptoms and significant prevalence of PMS was found in our study sample. Preventive and treatment strategies for PMS is highly recommended.",

    "abstract": "Qatar's much publicized liberalization campaign that began in the mid-1990s was a direct result of efforts by the new Amir, Shaykh Hamad, to compensate for his fragile base of support within the ruling Al Thani family by appealing to a broader base of Qataris and also to the international community. Historically, the Al Thani family had been one of the only centers of potential opposition to the reigning Amir, with merchant families or the religious establishment having been politically neutralized due to a variety of historical and structural reasons. Nevertheless, in relation to both groups the state has pursued a nuanced policy of simultaneous co-option and political incapacitation. Meanwhile, steady rises in oil and gas revenues allowed the state to significantly deepen its capacity in relation to society, and, by doing so, to ensure that groups from within civil society did not rise to positions of prominence. Within the Al Thanis, Shaykh Hamad undertook a number of significant changes, not the least of which was the creation of new institutions and offices that were staffed by his loyal supporters, including some of his sons and daughters. He also streamlined the line of succession to include only his own descendants. With the traditional political disquiet of the Al Thanis thus silenced, at least for now, all talks of liberalization have been dropped and the Qatari state remains fundamentally autocratic. © Middle East Institute.",

    "abstract": "This article argues that the tale (163, Nights 940-46)) from The Arabian Nights, entitled 'Abdullah of the Sea and cAbdullah of the Land' encapsulates highly spiritual and symbolical meanings that appear different on land and on sea. It is divided in three parts. The first tackles the view of a simple and clear Islam represented by a fisherman named cAbdullah. Part two deals with a more hermetic Islam embodied by a merman who bears the same name. Part three analyses the complex symbols encoded in the three even numbers, namely, two, four, and 40. The tale as a whole illustrates the difference between exoteric Islam (the Land), characterized by simplicity and clarity, and Sufi Islam, distinctive for its depth and its mystery (the Sea).",

    "title": "Arab media, corporate communications, and public relations: The case of Al Jazeera",
    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, public relations has developed significantly in the West into a sophisticated management function which is recognized as an integral part of any organization's attempt to communicate with various persons, both within and outside the organization, in order to achieve its goals and objectives. However, this is not the case in the Arab world where public relations remains underdeveloped and, even when practised, is relatively unsophisticated. This paper deals with the public relations function in a prominent though controversial Arab media organization: Al Jazeera Satellite Channel. It explores how Al Jazeera has been dealing with internal and external communication issues impelled initially by its role as a satellite broadcaster spearheading changes in a vibrant Arab mediascape and subsequently by its expansion into a global broadcaster. Drawing on James Grunig's four models of communication to analyze Al Jazeera's public relations practices, the case study at hand outlines some of the communication challenges and opportunities the organization has been facing during its 10 years of existence. The case of an indigenous organization like Al Jazeera operating in a culturally distinct environment puts into perspective communications issues and complicates our understanding of how public relations is understood and practised outside the normative Western public relations paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Iran Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Islamic Republic offers crucial insight for students and the general reader into an often misunderstood and complex country that is shrouded in mystery and misperception. Heir to a long history and a great culture and civilization, Iran embodies a rich, complex, and diverse mosaic that defines its national identity. Diversity is also the operative word that describes Iranian landscapes and geography, its multiple ethnic groups and their varied cultures and traditions, as well as the uneven and vastly different levels of economic and industrial development, conflicting political tendencies, and different and often contradictory social and cultural outlooks. Because of its tumultuous recent political history, Iran appears to encapsulate all of these internal differences and stark contrasts somewhat more distinctly than most of its neighbors. This encyclopedia is the source for up-to-date, authoritative information on a full range of critical topics of interest. Coverage of the Islamic Republic here falls into the general categories of history, politics, economics, society and culture. The most significant aspects of the life in Iran since the revolution-the era of the Islamic Republic so far-are stressed.",

    "abstract": "While religious guidance may be central in choosing a spouse or expectations from marriage, until the nineteenth century, it was the contractual nature of marriage that defined the actual union entered into by husband and wife and according to which they lived together. Most importantly, marriage contracts could and often did include specific conditions agreed upon by the parties to the contract. The modern period will witness a shift toward privileging the religious side of marriage at the cost of the contractual and women's agency would experience a serious shift due to modern personal status laws.",

Their works point to the epistemologic primacy of the contemplative and esoteric dimensions of the Book. Its linguistic texture and modalities are here understood as expressing the very limits of language, the proportional reciprocity between the actualization of inner meaning and spiritual fruition, and its ultimate metaphysical substance. These principles and their spiritual consequences may constitute the best antidote to contemporary fundamentalist and modernist reductionism in scriptural hermeneutics. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2007.",

    "abstract": "The Middle East's democracy deficit is a product of the patterns of political and economic development in the region. It is not because the region is predominantly Islamic or is somehow afflicted by purportedly undemocratic cultures. By itself, culture is not an impediment to transition to democracy as it is subject to influences from the larger polity, especially insofar as the economy and the initiatives of the state are concerned. Instead, transition to democracy is determined by the degree of society's autonomy from the state. This autonomy may result from the empowerment of society as a consequence of economic development, or the state elite's devolution of power to social actors and classes, or, more commonly, a combination of both. Assumptions about the inherently undemocratic nature of cultures such as Islamic and Confucian ones are fundamentally invalid. The key to understanding democratic transitions lies instead in the nature of state-society relations rather than the nature of society's norms and values in themselves. © 2007 Brill Academic Publishers.",

    "abstract": "In Muslim countries the Shari`ah is claimed to be the historical source of personal status laws, while criminal or commercial codes are imported from Europe. Islamic discrimination against women is a legacy of centuries of legal practice in Shari`ah courts. But, the Tanzimat reforms to personal law emerged from Turkish state resistance to European attempts at exploitation. The diffusion of law from one type of legal code into another is problematic because gender relation laws are based on the Shari`ah, & almost impossible to change. The contemporary reform of gender laws in Islamic countries is necessary to keep up with global conditions. Some legal changes have occurred in Muslim countries through the illustration of the historical genesis of personal status laws from various sources. These efforts must continue so that past & present interpretations do not claim exclusive religious sources of the Shari`ah. References. J. Harwell",

    "abstract": "Most research has accepted stereotypical images of Muslim women, treating their outward manifestations, such as veiling, as passive and oppressive. Muslim women have been depicted as different, and by exoticizing (orientalizing) them - or Islamic society in general - they have been dealt with outside of general women's history and regarded as having little to contribute to the writing of world history or to the life of their sisters worldwide. By approaching widely used sources with different questions and methodologies, and by using new or little-used material (with much primary research), this book redresses these deficiencies. Scholars revisit and reevaluate scripture and scriptural interpretation; church records involving non-Muslim women of the Arab world; archival court records dating from the present back to the Ottoman period; and the oral and material culture and its written record, including oral history, textbooks, sufi practices, and the politics of dress. By deconstructing the past, these scholars offer fresh perspectives on women's roles and aspirations in Middle East societies.",
